(198, 'Hands on: HTC One E8 review', '&quot;It seems HTC has managed to strip away just enough from the M8 to warrant the lower price - although I miss the metal chassis.&quot;', ' <p>The HTC One E8 is the phone I never thought I''d see. Given HTC''s big push into making design the most important element of its flagship  phone, why lose it?</p><p>And this theme returns when you turn the phone over: all the talk of the importance of the duo camera, with Ufocus and other assorted Ultrapixel gubbins, is gone in favour of an off-the-shelf 13MP sensor.</p><p>What gives, HTC? It''s nearly 30% cheaper? Oh. That makes sense.</p><p>Beyond that, we''re treated to the HTC One M8 spec for spec. That means a Snapdragon 801 chip inside, the same larger 2600mAh battery, a glorious Full HD 5-inch Super LCD3 screen, a microSD slot and, well, you might as well just read the spec sheet for the One M8 to get the full picture.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/htconee8review201-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One E8 review"></figure></p><p>Oh - the IR blaster on the top is gone. That''s important if you like the thought of controlling your TV with a phone.</p><h3>Plastic back</h3><p>So, let''s get down to it: how does the new polycarbonate cladding feel in the hand? I was sent the Electric Crimson version of the phone to test out (come on, if that''s an option on the list to choose, it was impossible to go for anything else) and it''s a shiny plastic, rather than the matte grey finish.</p><p>This means it''s as slippy, if not even less grippable, than the metal of the One M8, although if you plump for the matte version you''ll be able to hold onto it a little better.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/htconee8review2010-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One E8 review"><figcaption>It''s hard to explain how slippy this phone is</figcaption></figure></p><p>The plastic back feels solid, makes the phone lighter and, as I said, dispenses with the IR blaster on the top, which has the effect of moving the power button to the centre. It''s a slightly odd place to put it, but it''s easy to hit and still raised.</p><p>It''s intriguingly the same design as seen on the original ... well, intriguing if you''ve got nothing else to think about.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/htconee8review2011-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One E8 review"><figcaption>The power key - full of design mystery</figcaption></figure></p><p>The volume key on the right-hand side is also plastic, as you''d expect, and probably feels like the cheapest part of the phone. I''m not a fan of the lighter chassis, as I loved the great balance of the One M8, but the One E8 will probably appeal to those looking to spend less without losing the unibody package experience.</p><h3>No IR</h3><p>Is the lack of an infra-red port, the thing that lets you control your TV with your phone, a big loss to the phone? Well, apart from making the aesthetic of the One E8 a little less sumptuous, it''s barely missed.</p><p>I keep pointing out that holding your phone like a remote control is impossible as you''re missing the tactility of the buttons, but apart from LG with the  (which had the sensor on the back, meaning you could hold the phone up to see what you''re pressing) nobody has done anything about it.</p><p>The disappearance might irk some, but in reality it wouldn''t be missed on the One M8.</p><h3>Lower price</h3><p>Of course, the main reason for losing many of the good bits of the One M8 on the E8 is the price drop, and it''s pretty big considering.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/htconee8review2015-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One E8 review"><figcaption>The locked-in SIM and microSD trays remain</figcaption></figure></p><p>Word is it could come in at around &pound;350 in the UK, and will be around 30% cheaper than the One M8 in other markets SIM free, so if you get your hands on the One E8 (and that''s a big if, as HTC has yet to confirm availability in the more premium smartphone markets, focusing the E8 in other more developing parts of the world) you''ll be paying a lot less.</p><p>It''s hard to say whether this is the right move - it depends if the One M8 and E8 will be sold side by side. If they are, then it''s a cannibalisation exercise. People won''t want to pay that much more for a metal back and two cameras, and it could harm the sales of the One M8 as a result.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/htconee8review203-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One E8 review"><figcaption>Confirmed: you can use it on trees</figcaption></figure></p><p>Also, where does the One Mini 2 fit into the equation? Or the Desire 816? For a company that was planning to make fewer phones, HTC is certainly churning out the handsets.</p><h3>Upgraded camera</h3><p>Here''s something that will confuse a lot of people if the two phones are placed side by side in a shop (although we''ve yet to find out if they will): the camera on the HTC One E8 is going to be a 13MP affair, with single flash LED rather than the all-singing One M8, with its Duo Camera and Ultrapixels and Ufocus background defocus.</p><p>The 13MP snapper here has all the power and toys the One M8 has (bar the defocus post processing) so you can take Zoes, HDR shots, videos and more without a problem.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/htconee8review2017-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One E8 review"><figcaption>Doesn''t look as fancy as the Duo Camera</figcaption></figure></p><p>The front facing camera remains the same (well, I''m pretty sure about that but am awaiting confirmation) so this should be another brilliant phone if you like to take loads of self portraits. </p><p>But the back camera looks great still, and the sharpness from the off the shelf sensor seems to be very good indeed. HTC better hope that shops don''t sell these phones with 13MP and 4MP specs listed next to one another, or else it will get very confusing.</p><h3>Early verdict</h3><p>There''s a lot here that I''m missing from the One M8, but not as much as I thought I would. The build quality is a lot lower, but the colour of my sample and the well-packaged unibody mitigates that somewhat.</p><p>The camera, in the early tests, performs very well, but I''ve not tried it in the full range of low light and differing texture tests, so I''ll be intrigued to see how that pans out.</p><p>Essentially, this budget version of the One M8 isn''t that budget - but it does provide competition to the likes of the Nexus 5 and the OnePlus One for a high-end phone with great specs and a lower price, and it appears HTC has managed that well here.</p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/htconee8review204-160-80.jpg', ''),
(199, 'LG G2 review', '&quot;A stunning phone with amazing battery life that''s only let down by an overbearing UI.&quot;', ' <p>The  is a beastly smartphone and it was LG''s answer to 2013''s  and . It''s a large, yet not unwieldy, smartphone brimming with specs that would make the most discerning geeks drool.</p><p>LG has been a distant cry from where Samsung and HTC have found themselves in terms of popularity and smartphone ownership, although with the , , and G2 under its belt the Korean firm has got itself back on the smartphone map.</p><p>While it''s now been succeeded by the  and its stunning QHD display, the G2 is still available and at a cracking price making it a really great option if you''re on a bit more of a budget.</p><p>In fact, with a SIM-free price of around &pound;300 it''s more than &pound;150 cheaper than the 2014 flagship brigade, and while it may not sport Qualcomm''s latest Snapdragon 801 chip it still has the strong 800 version, a full HD display and Android 4.4.2 .</p><p>If you don''t fancy parting with &pound;300 up front you can now pick the LG G2 for free on contracts starting at &pound;21.99 per month.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/lg-g2-review-25-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G2 review"></figure></p><p>With the G2, it seemed that LG took a lot of cues from its Korean counterpart and built what many called a Galaxy S4 clone. It''s large, made of lots of plastic, shaped similarly and is jam-packed with more features than a single person can handle.</p><p>During its , I was a little baffled at what LG decided to highlight as the G2''s key features. The first and most evident is the placement of the power button and volume control keys. </p><p>LG went to great lengths to explain how it was listening to customers and observing their usage patterns. Somehow it all led to the awkward placement of those buttons, along with a few other things the phone can do.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="D8rmk71fXNrk8"></div><p>Diving right into what powers the  and makes it purr, you''ll first notice a 5.2-inch 1920 x 1080 display, which gives us a 424ppi density and means it still keeps pace with the likes of the  and .</p><p>The chipset inside is a 2.26GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 and as far as processing power, it seems that the G2 is in no short supply.</p><p>It comes in 16GB and 32GB variants, with 2GB RAM backing up that meaty processor, while connectivity includes Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, an IR blaster on the top of the G2 and 4G LTE. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/lgg2review2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G2 review"></figure></p><p>The camera on back is a 13MP shooter with a small LED flash. Like other high-end Android smartphones, it has a few tricks up its sleeves, too, but we''ll get into that in our camera section.</p><p>LG also made a big deal out of the battery in this thing, which is a 3000mAh Li-Po (Lithium Polymer) battery - that''s larger than the  (2600mAh) and Galaxy S5 (2800mAh), while the G3 sports the same size power pack as its predecessor.</p><p>Despite being a 5.2-inch display device, the LG G2 is very manageable in the hand. It still takes a reach to get your thumb diagonally across the screen, but it''s not so huge that it becomes cumbersome.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/lgg2review3-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G2 review"></figure></p><p>While it has the same size screen at 2014''s Xperia Z2, the G2 is smaller in terms of height and width measuring in at 128.5 x 70.9mm. That also makes its smaller than the Galaxy S5 and One M8 which boast 5.1-inch and 5-inch displays respectively.</p><p>To undiscerning eyes, it can be quite hard to tell the difference between the G2 and the Galaxy S4. One can argue that there is only so much you can do with the modern-day smartphone form factor, but then again HTC and Sony have very distinct designs.</p><p>The edges of the device are clean, free of volume controls and a power button. The bottom edge of the phone has a 3.5mm headset jack, micro-USB port and a speaker and microphone. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/lgg2review4-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G2 review"></figure></p><p>The G2''s backside is the business end of the phone. LG decided to put the volume buttons and power button just underneath the camera module. </p><p>LG says its the reason the volume and power keys were placed on the back is because that''s where your finger naturally wants to rest when you''re talking on your phone, which I generally found to be true.</p><p>It can become awkward feeling around for the buttons, as In order to get enough pressure onto the power button, you have to hold the G2 a little awkwardly and make sure you get the correct leverage. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/lgg2review8-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G2 review"></figure></p><p>But the South Korean brand has made a huge effort to mitigate this, with elements like double knocking on the screen to open it up (which removes the need to press the power button) and most apps have an onscreen volume control to play with.</p><p>Plus over time I noticed myself becoming increasingly okay with the placement of the keys - to the point when I switched phones and found that I was pressing the camera lens to turn the phone on.</p><p>Aside from the power/volume buttons and the camera module on the backside, there isn''t a whole lot more going on back there. </p><p>The metal-looking LG logo towards the bottom of the device however turns out to be just a few stickers, which over time have started to fall off.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/lgg2review1-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G2 review"></figure></p><p>The plastic rear chassis also gets beaten up pretty easily, and if you''re not careful your G2 will pick up various dents and markings. I recommend purchasing a case to prolong its life and keep it looking smart.</p><p>Up front you won''t find any physical buttons at all. The back, home and menu buttons are all soft keys on the display, and will respond with haptic feedback unless you disable it. </p><p>Overall, the design of the LG G2 is nice, with the exception of the placement of the power and volume buttons. And although I''m not particularly fond of an all-plastic body, it''s not so bad and I found the G2 to be a well built, solid device.</p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/g2-press-01-160-80.jpg', ''),
(200, 'Samsung Galaxy S3 review', '&quot;The best smartphone around right now with a whole suite of premium features to play with.&quot;', ' <p>The Samsung Galaxy S3 has been available in the market for over two years now, but with the recent update to  and further price reductions thanks to the recent introduction of the  there''s still a lot going for the aging handset.</p><p>We''re currently putting the Galaxy S3 through its paces with the new software on board, taking into account its new, lower price point of &pound;200 (around $290, AU$380) and the fresh competition it''s facing. </p><p>We''ll update this review shortly with our latest findings on whether the S3 is still worth a punt if you''re looking for an affordable smarphone.</p><p>It''s mostly changes to the interface that have been brought with the new update, but there are a few other areas that have been updated with the new breed of TouchWiz.</p><ul><li> | </li></ul><p>Samsung has made a big deal about this phone, not only choosing to launch it at a big and glitzy standalone event in London but has managed to  - and given the amount of people we see rocking the handset on the trains these days, those number seem to bear a hallmark of truth.</p><p>The price is pretty palatable for a top-end phone &ndash; some sites are offering it for around &pound;26 per month with a very low up front cost,</p><p>But let''s get down to the main question &ndash; is this the phone you should be spending your hard-earned cash on?</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="7LZ1JV2TAJ3sY"></div><h3>Design</h3><p>The Samsung Galaxy S3 is, according to Samsung anyway, ''inspired by nature &ndash; it sees, listens, responds, and enables you to share the greatest moments''.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys3review01-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 review"></figure></p><p>While this is all a little hyperbolic, the nature theme is certainly present when you handle the phone for the first time. </p><p>Brushed polycarbonate &ndash; you''ve got a choice of ''Marble White'' and ''Pebble Blue'' &ndash; adorns the large device, which runs in with dimensions of 136.6 x 70.6 x 8.6mm, despite still having to pack in a 4.8-inch Super AMOLED HD screen.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="uST651wdM1VK5"></div><p>We''ll lay it out right now: the plastic feeling of the Galaxy S3 won''t appeal to all. It feels very lightweight (despite tipping the scales at 133g) in the hand, and some people will read this as feeling a little cheap.</p><p>However, it''s exactly the same sensation as we found on the , and given the silly numbers of sales that had, we think there''s more than a market for a phone that you''ll barely notice in your pocket most of the time.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys3review10-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 review"></figure></p><p>But we''ll be very clear on this - the Galaxy S3 is not a cheap-feeling phone. It''s got a really solid Gorilla Glass 2 front, a well-packaged interior and a more robust battery cover. It''s polycarbonate rather than bog-standard plastic, although we''re not sure some people will like the more rounded nature of the design.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys3review11-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 review"></figure></p><p>However, despite being made of similar material, there''s no doubt that the  feels more premium in the hand. Although the One X is actually 3g lighter than the Galaxy S3, it feels a touch weightier, which shows the way texture can affect the way a phone feels in the hand. And there''s something about an object so large feeling so light that some will find disconcerting in the S3.</p><p>There''s no doubt in our minds that the Pebble Blue offering is the much more attractive option, since the Marble White looks similar to a low-end  or similar &ndash; the brushed effect is really necessary. And now we''ve got a host of extra colours to play with (Titanium Grey, Garnet Red, Amber Brown and Sapphire Black) so the sky really is the limit here... although actually, there''s no Sky Blue option.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/galaxys3-newcolours-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 review"></figure></p><p>Compared to rest of the Galaxy line, the S3 has more in common with the original  than the S2, with curved edges the theme in the design language. The home button has also been elongated, although the same menu and back buttons remain from the prequel.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys3review04-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 review"></figure></p><p>Overall, the effect is much more like the  than anything else &ndash; rounded edges, HD screen but with a more minimal bezel to really accentuate the larger screen in the hand.</p><p>The button design around the phone has been well thought out in our opinion - for a phone this big it''s very difficult to make all the keys accessible, so putting the lock button on the right-hand side rather than the top makes a large degree of sense.</p><p>The addition of the lozenge-shaped home button, and its softkey ''Back'' and ''Menu'' buttons are great additions in our eyes, as it means contextual menus can be found easily without needing to mess around looking for the on-screen icon.</p><p>The volume up and down button is parallel to the lock key on the left-hand side of the phone, and also within easy reach when holding the Galaxy S3 in the hand.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys3review05-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 review"></figure></p><p>The microUSB slot is placed at the bottom of the phone - easy to find with a charger but it will be interesting to see how it''s used when placed in docks and car cradles.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys3review06-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 review"></figure></p><p>The battery cover is also made of the same polycarbonate material as the rest of the body. Yes, you read that right - the battery cover is removable. The future isn''t all unibody, it seems.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys3review12-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 review"></figure></p><p>This means that not only can you switch the battery in and out - a key consideration for many people - there''s also a cheeky surprise in the shape of a microSD slot next to the microSIM port. Expandable memory? This just gets better and better.</p><p>This means that theoretically you''ll be able to have a 128GB-capacity Samsung Galaxy S3 if you combine the top spec of internal memory (64GB) with the largest microSD card around at the moment (64GB)... making it a mouth-watering prospect for those who love a spot of media. However, we''re still waiting to see the 64GB Samsung Galaxy S3 variant make an entrance, as it looks like retailers are going off the idea of such a high capacity model.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys3review13-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 review"></figure></p><p>Sure, there are stats that say only 10% of users regularly go over 16GB of storage, but there''s always the lower end version of the Galaxy S3 for that. With HD movie downloads becoming far more prevalent, plus the influx of HD apps, we think more space is an excellent idea.</p><p>Overall the Samsung Galaxy S3 feels superb in the hand. The design contours well against the palm, and while the screen size may be a little big for some (you''ll need a bit of shuffling to reach the upper section of the screen) it''s definitely more than useable day to day.</p><p>So in short: if you don''t mind a slightly lighter-feeling polycarbonate shell and you like big HD screens in your pocket, this is a phone definitely worth checking out.</p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/samsunggalaxys3review10-160-80.jpg', ''),
(201, 'Nokia X review', '&quot;A well built and designed budget smartphone that shows off some of the best of Nokia. It''s let down by weak performance, but at the right price it''s a strong offering despite an uncertain future.&quot;', ' <p>Ever since Nokia decided to go all-in with Windows Phone, there has been a nagging feeling that it would have been better off using Android as its mobile operating system of choice.</p><p>A feeling that has got stronger as Android devices have so rapidly taken over the lion''s share of smartphone sales.</p><p>At Mobile Web Congress in February 2014, Nokia finally fulfilled this dream by announcing the Nokia X range comprising the Nokia X (reviewed here), a higher specified  and the physically larger . Not just one Android phone, but a whole range.</p><p>There was more than a little irony in seeing Stephen Elop, once a Microsoft stalwart and the architect of Nokia''s Windows Phone strategy announcing these new devices on stage. He went to great pains to point out that the Nokia X is a phone running AOSP, the Android Open Source Project.</p><p>This project underpins every Android phone in the world. As always in the Nokia story, it is not quite as simple as that. While the Nokia X runs Android, it does not run Google Android.</p><p>Briefly, Android as we know it is typically made of two parts; the underlying Android system and the Google apps. The underlying Android system is what the Nokia X runs along with all the usual well known Android phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S range and the .</p><p>Unlike those devices though, the Nokia X does not run Google apps. In order to run Google apps &ndash; Gmail, Maps, Calendar, Google Now etc &ndash; phones need to be certified. Nokia has not taken this step and it has done so on purpose.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia X"></figure></p><p>The Nokia X software is based off of Android 4.1, a version released in July 2012. There is so far no information on updates but we can only hope  is planned as that version is designed to run on lower end hardware.</p><p>Nokia has designed the X to use the equivalent services from itself and from Microsoft, and Nokia has provided an API for everything that Google provides meaning that developers should be able to port apps quite easily.</p><p>This makes the Nokia X an Android phone by name, but one that would perhaps be unfamiliar to those already used to running Android on other mainstream devices. If you are thinking of switching to the Nokia X from another Android device, it is most important to note that the Play Store is not available. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p3-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia X"></figure></p><p>It is possible to side-load any legally obtainable apps including other app stores such as the Amazon app store, but even that wont bring Google services to the Nokia X.</p><p>Who would have imagined a Microsoft product running Android? It does seem like an anomaly, and by the looks of it that''s exactly what the Nokia X will be - an anomaly.</p><p>Microsoft has announced that it will be , leaving just four Nokia branded handsets running the heavily modified version of Google''s platform - the X, X+, XL and X2.</p><p>Moving on from this muted outlook, what do you get on the Nokia X? The standout software included are Nokia HERE Maps, a fantastic alternative to Google apps, and Nokia MixRadio which is a great way to stream your favorite music on demand. </p><p>Instead of the Play Store you will find the Nokia Store, which is already starting to fill out with many top apps. Nokia include Facebook and Twitter apps along with BlackBerry Messenger as standard. Various simple games are loaded on the X as well. All these apps run on a heavily customised version of Android 4.1.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p4-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia X review"></figure></p><p>Powering the Nokia X is a dual-core Snapdragon S4 Play processor running at 1GHz with 512Mb of RAM and 4GB of internal storage, which can be supplemented by a microSD card. The X has a 4-inch WVGA (800 x 480) LCD display and a fixed focus 3MP camera on the back. There''s no front facing shooter.</p><p>These are very modest specs indeed and that does end up informing the whole experience of using the Nokia X.</p><p>What makes up for that is the price, the range starts at just &euro;89, &pound;80 (around $120, AU$135). This is a phone targeted at emerging markets, at people who are buying their first smartphone and perhaps their first phone. Some buyers of the Nokia X will have never bought any sort of computing device before.</p><p>Nokia has brought the X range to Europe, including the UK, but it has been clearly designed to replace the top end of Nokia''s Asha range of phones. The Asha range is filled with very nicely designed but slow and simple feature phones, which have very limited capabilities. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/screen20on-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia X review"></figure></p><p>The Nokia X is a decent step up from an Asha device and has the potential to do a lot more. Here in the UK, other reasonable smartphones are available for a similar price as the X but in its first market, India, this is not the case. Phones at a similar price point suffer from extremely bad design and build quality and very poor performance.</p><p>Despite the meager specifications and just a 1500mAh battery, the Nokia X provides a reasonable upgrade for users in these emerging markets who are upgrading from either feature phones or locally produced budget handsets which simply will not have Nokia''s level of design and build.</p><p>When you pull the rear shell off the Nokia X model it is possible to see another indicator as to the target markets for this new range. The Nokia X is a dual SIM device.</p><p>In many other markets, the best value for cellular connectivity is achieved by separating your contracts for voice usage and data usage, which mandates two SIM cards. It''s like running your calls through Vodafone and your data through T-Mobile.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/buttons-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia X review"></figure></p><p>On the X, the dual SIM setup supports dual standby that means both SIM cards can be active at the same time. Only slot one supports 3G connections, so that is where you will want to put your data SIM. Both slots are of the micro SIM variety. There is no 4G in sight here, but that is hardly a surprise.</p><p>The X range comes in a lovely range of colours with the basic X is available in black, white, cyan, yellow, bright red and the bright green, which is especially striking.

(202, 'Nokia Lumia 930 review', '&quot;The Lumia 930 is the most complete Windows Phone to date. It''s the first to properly challenge the flagship might of Android and iOS with its impressive design, new Windows Phone 8.1 software and all round decent specs.&quot;', ' <p>Windows Phone is going on four years old now &ndash; and it''s still never had the standout phone that shows it''s a platform that can compete with the iPhone and the best Android has to offer.</p><p>The Nokia Lumia 930 looks to be just that phone, with a next-generation screen, a much-improved processor and a new version of the OS to give users more customisation than ever before.</p><p>This is still a Nokia phone, despite the buyout by Microsoft, and the heritage is plain to see with the choice of coloured plastic backs combined with the metallic trim.</p><p>But here''s the key question: does the Nokia Lumia 930 have the ability to mix it with the big boys? It''s got a higher spec sheet than ever before, the still-great camera and all of the Finnish / American toys it can pack on board, and it''s coming out of the gate for cheaper than the competition too.</p><p>On top of that you''ve got a decent accessory ecosystem around it, a strong identity and an ever-growing user base for Windows Phone.</p><p>But there''s also the other side of it: the Lumia 930 is using last year''s components and still has to battle against the fact Windows Phone is still running behind iOS and Android in both the popularity and app stakes.</p><p>It''s a tricky one &ndash; read on to see if the new Lumia could possibly be your next phone.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="WFq6qWQ6653WO"></div><h3>ClearBlack display</h3><p>The first thing that you''ll notice about the -powered device is the fact it''s got a much improved screen over its predecessors. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/nokia20lumia2093020review2013-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>The ClearBlack display is just that: clear and capable of display deep blacks</figcaption></figure></p><p>Yes, the  had a large 1080p screen, but it was much bigger than the 5-inch version on show here and as such the sharpness suffered as a result.</p><p>But the AMOLED ClearBlack display used on the Lumia 930 is just brilliant. I''ve had too many tedious arguments with others about the benefits of LCD over OLED technology (yes, such is the effervescent life of a technology journalist) but you can''t argue that OLED just looks better.</p><p>Whether it''s the deep blacks, rich contrast or generally decent colour reproduction (which Nokia has nailed with its ClearBlack technology) the screen quality on the Lumia 930 is a really lovely experience.</p><p>It makes the live tiles really stand out on the home screen, and combined with Nokia''s love of colour, the whole effect is really rather nice. </p><p>One of the key benefits of OLED technology is the fact that when a portion of the screen is black, it''s completely switched off. This means that the disparity between bright white sections and the darker portions is more apparent, and from the moment you switch on the Lumia 930 you get the sense that this is a good quality phone.</p><p>There''s also the battery saving element (if a pixel is off, it''s drawing a lot less power... actually, pretty much none) so that''s a benefit too.</p><h3>Metallic rim</h3><p>I''m going to come onto the design of the Lumia 930 in the next section of this review, but it''s worth talking about here as it''s something Nokia is using as a real selling point for its new handset.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/nokia20lumia2093020review206-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>A strong edge</figcaption></figure></p><p>The combination of a metallic rim and polycarbonate back is nothing new, but Nokia''s bolstered the strength of the phone with this year''s design, and it works pretty well.</p><p>The lighter grey exterior has a very Scandinavian feel to it, and combines well with the brighter colours - although you can get black and white versions if you prefer your smartphone a bit more low key.</p><p>It feels solid in the hand, but the weight and thickness is pretty hefty for a 2014 flagship smartphone... it''s hard to work out why Nokia has increased things here, but it''s definitely a design that stands out from the crowd and offers a very well-built phone.</p><h3>Windows Phone 8.1</h3><p>Again, I feel like I''m ruining a later section, but the update to Windows Phone is a key selling point of the Lumia 930, at least in the early days of sale.</p><p>There aren''t a huge amount of phones packing the update at this point, and users will benefit from new elements like a notification area (Action Center), more options with the background wallpaper and more live tile options than ever before.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/nokia20lumia2093020review2010-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>It''s good, but still needs more to impress</figcaption></figure></p><p>Sadly, in the UK there''s no look at Cortana yet, but that will be coming pretty soon we''re told, and that will offer some decent access to one of the best voice assistants on a smartphone.</p><p>Windows Phone 8.1 pushes the OS forward by a huge amount - it was sorely needed, and doesn''t quite get it up with the best, but just a little bit closer. Nokia''s Lumia 930 is a good poster boy for this, and the combination of power and design gives a good experience under the finger.</p><h3>Pureview 20MP camera</h3><p>Nokia''s camera heritage has been a mainstay of the mobile phone for nearly a decade now, since the decision to stick a snapper on the back of a handset.</p><p>With Pureview Nokia''s really owning this space, with the  still arguably the best camera-on-a-phone out there (not the best cameraphone, as what''s running underneath is sub par).</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/nokia20lumia2093020review203-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>A great snapper</figcaption></figure></p><p>The Pureview sensor on the Lumia 930 is similar to that seen on the Lumia 1520, which is a shame, as I was really hoping for something really advanced and could allow me to stop carrying the 1020 around with me.</p><p>It''s not in the same league as the 41MP sensor on that device, but it''s still very much one of the best on the market, as you''ll see with the later camera samples.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="PSB8lAvB1w850"></div><h3>Here and there</h3><p>Another of Nokia''s big strengths is the Here suite of products that it bundles with the Nokia Lumia range - and will probably be completely available on all Windows Phone devices in the future if Microsoft has anything to say about it.</p><p>The big hitters are Here Maps and Mix Radio in my opinion - the former being a big win because of the ability to take maps offline as well as relevant information being spread throughout the app.</p><p>It''s a much better app than it used to be too - while you still need to download plugins to make it fully functional, at least those extra bits are now available. It allows for easy mapping and is arguably a more coherent sat nav option than those from Apple or Google, which you should note if you''re one to use your phone to navigate around in the car.</p><p>However, it''s still not up to the standard of Google Maps, either in interface or general functionality. What you gain in offline capability and relevant information you lose in general interface - the slower way of flicking through the map (even with the extra grunt of the quadcore Snapdragon 800 chip running under the hood) shows that this is still something that needs more work to be a real competitor.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/nokia20lumia2093020review2018-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>Nokia''s onboard app offering still needs work</figcaption></figure></p><p>Mix Radio is an interesting proposition though. The idea is that it forces new music onto you (and for free, which is brilliant) and even lets you sync offline without paying any more.</p><p>The range of genres and pre-mixed playlists is really something, and despite downloading Spotify as well (which needs a lot more work on Windows Phone) I found myself initially drawn to this app to see what was on offer music-wise.</p><p>However, it didn''t take long to start to fall out of love, as it relies heavily on a connection most of the time, and if you go underground or on a train with low signal it can really upset the functionality of the app. This means that the playback won''t work over and over again despite being able to connect, and if you''ve part-downloaded a playlist it will confuse the life out of the app.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/lumia930-press-02-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>The mapping experience disappoints</figcaption></figure></p><p>You can pay &pound;3.99/$3.99 per month and get better access to the features of the app, such as improved audio quality and unlimited skips through songs, but it''s not really that much better than the free version. </p><p>Plus you need to sign up through a Nokia account (you can do it through a Microsoft login, but that''s not quite integrated yet, which leads to an email asking you to sort out a Nokia account still) which seems a bit last century nowadays.</p><p>There are plenty of decent apps from Nokia and Microsoft to download (or are pre-installed on the phone) that really add to the functionality though - everything from Video Tuner (which allows you to easily make more shareable videos) to Nokia Beamer (an awesome app that lets you mirror your phone screen on any internet-connected device in the world) so at least the Windows Phone experience is working hard at its own apps to make the experience more enticing.</p><h3>Wireless charging</h3><p>Nokia needs to work out what it really wants when it comes to wireless charging. Enabled in the , it''s been stripped out of subsequent light-named smartphones.</p><p>It''s back in the Lumia 930, and as such adds a huge amount of heft to the design, apparently. I get that Nokia decided to let it be an option extra in recent models, in the shape of a snap-on case, as that gave consumers choice.</p><p>Sadly, it seemed that they chose to not use it, so Nokia has made it mandatory once again. It''s great to see, and even better that there''s a wireless charging pad in the box - THAT''S what consumers need to make wireless charging happen.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/lumia930-press-04-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>The wireless charger comes in the box</figcaption></figure></p><p>However, I don''t get why it''s added so much depth to the phone (assuming that''s the reason), as other models, such as the , can manage it in a very slim profile.</p><p>But overall wireless charging being part of the set up is a big, big win. Not needing to plug your phone in for the first time as you put your head on the pillow is really awesome - this is the kind of futuristic stuff I was expecting years ago.</p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/nokia20lumia2093020review2011-160-80.jpg', ''),
(203, 'Nokia Lumia 635 review', '&quot;Nokia''s latest budget phone sports 4G and Windows Phone 8.1 out of the box, and benefits from all of the things we liked about the Lumia 630. However, it''s not quite enough of an improvement to justify the additional premium.&quot;', ' <p>The Nokia Lumia 635 adds a sprinkling of 4G magic and external bling to the impressively solid and ultra-affordable . It makes a positive first impression but is its existence strictly necessary?</p><p>While Microsoft''s modern Windows Phone reinvention was intended as a premium smartphone experience, Nokia has recently established that the low-end is where it''s at for the platform. </p><p>With the  flying off shelves (relative to previous Windows Phone handsets at least),  is establishing itself as a bona fide alternative to all those cheap (and often nasty) Android phones.</p><p>The Nokia Lumia 630 showed off Nokia''s current vision of a classy entry-level phone, and the Nokia Lumia 635 is identical in all but three areas.</p><p>The first and perhaps most notable of those areas is its price tag. At the time of writing, Nokia is touting a SIM-free price from &pound;129.95 (around US$238 / AU$255) for the Lumia 635 compared to a &pound;110 (US$189 / AU$201) price tag for the 630.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/press203-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 635 review"><figcaption>The Nokia Lumia 635 sits firmly in the budget smartphone price range</figcaption></figure></p><p>That additional cost gets you 4G LTE network connectivity, as well as a glossy finish to the Lumia 635''s colourful rear cover. Is that really worth the price bump?</p><p>Alongside these extras, the Nokia Lumia 635 offers the same 4.5-inch 854 x 480 display, the same quad-core Snapdragon 400 CPU backed by 512MB of RAM, the same 8GB of storage, and the same 5-megapixel rear camera as the 630.</p><p>In fact, it inherits pretty much all of its sibling''s strengths and weaknesses. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/press201-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 635 review"><figcaption>As you''d expect for a Nokia phone, the Lumia 635 comes in a selection of bright colours</figcaption></figure></p><p>With the average smartphone size seemingly expanding by the year, the Nokia Lumia 635 almost feels small in the hand. In fact, moving from an  to the Lumia 635 didn''t feel like such a jolting leap as moving to something like the  or the  did.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/hold20front-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 635 review"><figcaption>This smartphone size is just right</figcaption></figure></p><p>But with a 4.5-inch display, it''s small in relative terms only. In fact, I''d probably say that the Nokia Lumia 635''s screen is very close to optimal in terms of the balance between single-handed usability and widescreen media clarity.</p><p>Sadly the Lumia 635''s screen is not going to show your HD movies or favourite web pages in the best light. At 854 x 480, the resolution is distinctly behind the smartphone curve. The similarly priced , for example, offers the same size of screen with a 1280 x 720 resolution.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/beer20reflection-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 635 review"><figcaption>The screen resolution is a little disappointing</figcaption></figure></p><p>Still, Nokia has always had a number of display tricks up its sleeve, and the Lumia 635 is no different. IPS and ClearBlack technology combine to ensure that viewing angles and outdoor legibility are above what you''d normally expect from a "cheap" smartphone.</p><p>However, I was disappointed that there was no apparent sign of Nokia''s super sensitive touch display technology, meaning you can''t operate the phone with gloves on. This was even present in the Nokia Lumia 520, so it''s not as if it''s a high-end feature.</p><p>Nor do you get the desirable tap-to-power-on option that the likes of the  possessed, or the ability to glance at the time and whether you have any new notifications by hovering your finger over the display. The absence of these features is perhaps a little more understandable as Nokia strives to keep costs down on the Lumia 635.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/hold20headphone-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 635 review"><figcaption>Headphones are plugged into the top of the phone</figcaption></figure></p><p>Aside from a somewhat underwhelming display, the Nokia Lumia 635 is a pretty desirable piece of kit. Like the Nokia Lumia 630, it features a clever two-part design that almost makes it feel like one of Nokia''s premium unibody constructions.</p><p>The screen, the removable battery, and all of the phone''s innards for that matter are all contained within a skeletal core unit. The other part of the Lumia 635 is an extended cover, made of fairly thick plastic (or ''polycarbonate'' to use the fancy official branding), which fits around the back and the sides of the device.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/back20bench-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 635 review"><figcaption>The case is sturdy, but that glossy effect isn''t the most attractive look</figcaption></figure></p><p>Once clicked into place, this is a solid device with minimal flexing or creaking. We''ve said it before, but no one does affordable phone design as well as Nokia.</p><p>Having said that, I didn''t find the Nokia Lumia 635 to be as nice to look at or hold as the Nokia Lumia 630. It''s opted for a glossy dual-layer effect, which makes it look like it''s covered by a thin, clear gel layer.</p><p>While this differentiates the Lumia 635 from the 630, I preferred the latter''s matte finish. Not only does it look nicer (which is admittedly subjective), it also feels nicer in the hand (which is less so). There''s a certain clammy greasiness that accompanies the Lumia 635''s slick finish, especially in warmer conditions.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/hold20side-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 635 review"><figcaption>The Lumia 635 is a reasonably slim phone</figcaption></figure></p><p>Otherwise, the dimensions of these two Nokia Lumia phones are identical. Like the 630, the Lumia 635 weighs 134g, and measures 9.2mm thick. Not the slimmest or lightest of smartphones, then, but neither is it the bulkiest.</p><p>With identical dimensions you can swap a glossy cover for a matte finish one on the 635, so if you really can''t live with the shiny shell there is an easy work around.</p><p>Button layout is as I like it for any phone over 4-inches in size (which is the vast majority these days), with both the volume and power keys located on the right-hand edge of the phone. This makes them nicely reachable when held naturally in one hand - whether you''re talking right or left.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/buttons-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 635 review"><figcaption>The lack of dedicated camera button is disappointing</figcaption></figure></p><p>One omission that might rankle with faithful Windows Phone users is the lack of a dedicated camera button. In previous phones this would grant point-and-shoot-like two-stage control over your shots, not to mention reliable snaps when in a rush or shooting from an awkward position.</p><p>It would also grant the quickest and most reliable shortcut to the camera app possible. It was missed here, but it''s one more element that''s been sacrificed in the name of cost cutting, and it''s an understandable one.</p><p>Nokia has included a microSD card slot in the Lumia 635, which is a good job given the scant 8GB available internally. You''ll need to remove both the rear cover and the battery to access this port, though, just as you do with the microSIM slot.</p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/front20angle-160-80.jpg', '');

In the UK you can grab the Z2 for free on two year contracts starting at &pound;30 per month.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/xperiaz2-handson-11-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 review"></figure></p><p>That puts the Sony Xperia Z2 pretty much on par with its direct rivals, although it''s slightly cheaper then some now, so if you''re looking for a way to choose between them pricing isn''t a factor that''ll help you make up your mind.</p><p>You''d be hard pushed to tell the Z1 and the Z2 apart, as they look almost identical with the same metal and glass design providing a sturdy and premium, if not a little industrial, finish.</p><p>The slabs of glass on the front and rear of the Xperia Z2 may add a level of class to the handset, but they''re also a magnet for fingerprints and dust.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/xperiaz2-handson-14-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 review"></figure></p><p>I was constantly wiping the Sony Xperia Z2 to clear the smudges off the screen, but within minutes they built up again. This got rather frustrating after a while, and with exactly the same thing happening round the back I felt like I was fighting a losing battle.</p><p>On a positive note the Xperia Z2''s body appears to be far more robust than that of the Z1 and , which were found to scratch and scuff remarkably easily making the handsets look bruised and battered.</p><p>Round the front Sony continues its trend of sizable bezels above and below the display, extending the length of the Xperia Z2 making it taller than its predecessor as well as the One M8 and Galaxy S5.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/xperiaz2-handson-16-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 review"></figure></p><p>These extra large bezels do detract slightly from the overall finish of the handset, but I suspect in a similar fashion to the black bar below the screen on the One M8, they''re all about squeezing in the latest tech under the hood.</p><p>Sony has narrowed the width and shaved off some of the depth in an attempt to make the Xperia Z2 usable in one hand, and for the most part it is.</p><p>It''s by no way a small device, but I was able to hold the Xperia Z2 in my hand and access pretty much the whole expanse for the 5.2-inch display without calling in my second paw.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/xperiaz2-handson-20-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 review"></figure></p><p>The metal and glass body doesn''t give a huge amount of grip, and the flat angular design means it''s not the comfiest handset to hold for extended period of times.</p><p>I came straight from the HTC One M8 to the Xperia Z2 and the curved rear on the HTC made it far more palm friendly than Sony''s offering.</p><p>Perhaps a nod towards HTC is the arrival of dual front facing speakers on the Xperia Z2, although at first glance you may not notice they''re there.</p><p>Sony has been far more subtle with its placement compared to HTC, with small deviations in design at the top and bottom of the Xperia Z2''s frame revealing slender speaker grills.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/xperiaz2-handson-02-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 review"></figure></p><p>That subtle integration does mean that the bezels above and below the display are more pronounced, where as at least on the M8 the additional height appears more justified thanks to the big grills.</p><p>Hidden behind the upper speaker is a RGB notification LED, allowing the Xperia Z2 to alert you to a new message, Facebook post or email without you having to wake the screen. Different colours denote notifications from different services, making it easier for you to decide whether or not to check it out.</p><p>Flip the Xperia Z2 to landscape for a movie marathon or gaming session and you''ll immediately benefit from the new speaker location. The Xperia Z1 had its speaker location on its base which was easily covered when held in landscape.</p><p>Back to portrait and the centralised power/lock key down the right side of the Xperia Z2 nestles under your thumb or finger, making it extremely easy to access.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/xperiaz2-handson-01-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 review"></figure></p><p>The volume rocker sits just below, again in an easy to reach position, while towards the base of the handset you''ll find the dedicated shutter key which provides a shortcut to the camera app as well as a way to snap pictures underwater.</p><p>Sony has kept up its dust- and waterproofing tradition with the Xperia Z2 and thus you find the first of two flappy bits on the right of the handset.</p><p>It''s tasked with covering the microSD slot, allowing you to build on the mediocre 16GB of internal storage with support of cards up to 128GB in size.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/xperiaz2-handson-08-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 review"></figure></p><p>I found this flap, and the one of the left side covered the microSIM and microUSB ports, easy to remove and replace - although I fear for their durability. All it takes is for one of those flaps to fail and next time you take your Xperia Z2 into the bath it''s game over.</p><p>There have already been reports of the Xperia Z2 failing to keep the water out, but during my dunking time with the handset I didn''t experience any leakage. Just remember to close those flaps firmly!</p><p>It is frustrating to have to open a flap to access the charging port, and with it being located on the side of the device rather than the base like the Galaxy S5, it makes the Z2 harder to handle when plugged in.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/xperiaz2-handson-07-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 review"></figure></p><p>Anyone looking to upgrade from the original Xperia Z though will be pleased to see an uncovered headphone jack up top, continuing the tradition from the Z1.</p><p>Round the back the Xperia Z2 doesn''t look that much different than the front, with the understated 20.7MP camera lens and single LED flash the only blemishes on the glass covered surface.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/xperiaz2-handson-22-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 review"></figure></p><p>The Sony Xperia Z2 doesn''t do anything outlandish in terms of style, and it''s yet another black slab of glass - but it is a well built, premium, functional and waterproof device which certainly trumps the design of the Galaxy S5.</p><p>If you''re looking for something seriously stylish though you''re probably better off with the  or HTC One M8.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="m7uC9VDKA1wfB"></div> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/14xperiaz2water-160-80.jpg', ''),

Well, mostly is.

Where before Apple was able to just create the phone it wanted, and forget the competition in the knowledge that it wasn''t going to have to worry about losing consumers to a competitor, now it''s been forced to realise that there are at least four decent options for a consumer to think about if they want to get a rather good handset.</p><p>Apple is obviously aware of this change, be it the aluminium unibody of the , the new fight into low-light cameras or the need for a strong processor as a headline to shout about. And to be fair, it''s addressed these needs to some degree or other on the iPhone 5S.</p><p>Whether it''s the all-new Touch ID home button (which is excellent, more on that later), the huge jump in CPU power or the fact the camera has, once again, been improved no end, the new iPhone is clearly Apple''s attempt at bringing as much as it can to the party without having to re-design the whole concept all over again.</p><p>There are many that think releasing the same design twice is cheeky, and there are others who realise that sometimes there''s no need for change. It''s easy to fall into the former camp, and while Apple will happily point out it''s not <em>forcing </em>anyone to buy its phones, its acutely aware the competition is now scarily strong and it needed to bring its best to stay relevant.</p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/5s20fancy20colors-160-80.jpg', ''),
(206, 'Samsung Galaxy S5 review', '&quot;Powerful, competent and with a whole new UI, it''s a shame that Samsung hasn''t progressed further with the look of its new challenger.&quot;', ' <p>The Samsung Galaxy S5 can be defined by one word: evolution. </p><p>The camera has evolved to give clearer, faster snaps. The fitness-tracking abilities of the S5 are enhanced over the  by packing in a more powerful S Health app and a dedicated heart rate monitor on the rear. A fingerprint scanner adds to the most secure Galaxy phone ever made.</p><p>The battery is larger, the screen bigger and brighter, the processor quicker and the design altered.</p><p>The spec sheet certainly doesn''t let it down: a 2.5GHz quad-core CPU, 2GB of RAM, a 2800mAh (removable) battery, 16 / 32GB of memory (with up to 128GB extra through microSD), one of the world''s most vibrant screens that''s been extended to 5.1-inches and added biometrics.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p1060941-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 review"><figcaption>Mud still penetrated the casing</figcaption></figure></p><p>However, it''s hard to point to one stand out feature that will grab the prospective user when they handle the Galaxy S5 for the first time.</p><p>To many, that won''t matter, as Samsung''s built a fan-base that only Apple can rival, and a number will be picking up the new Galaxy without a second thought over whether it competes adequately with its rivals.</p><ul><li>Already sold? Check out the best  here</li></ul><p>Price-wise, if you''re shocked by the cost of the Samsung Galaxy S5 then you''ve not really been paying attention to the previous flagship models. It''s actually a little cheaper than previous years in some territories, coming in at around &pound;550-&pound;600 SIM free in the UK, $650+ in the US and AU$900.</p><p>As you can imagine contract offers are flying all over the place at the moment, but the Galaxy S5 is being offered for a near identical price to the  and the  give or take a few dollarpounds.</p><p>The messaging around the launch of the Galaxy S5 was that Samsung had listened to the consumers and dialled down the gimmicks, focusing instead on what makes a phone special to the consumer.</p><p>It promised a ''fashionable'' and ''glam'' design, a camera that works in the way you''d want it to and strength through being water resistant.</p><p>There''s also the small notion of an improved version - I was told that it was very likely the Galaxy S5 was going to launch with a  version in February, with oodles more RAM, a faster processor and QHD screen on board. </p><p>However, that was pushed back (likely to do with issues in creating the screen in high enough volumes) and has since appeared in the South Korea-only  version. This one has a Snapdragon 805 CPU, a WQHD screen and all the high end features you can wish for. In short, it''s the amazing phone I wish Samsung had announced a few months ago and sold all over the world.</p><p>Then there''s also the , which is rumoured to be coming in September and will essentially be the Galaxy S5 in a metallic chassis... and possibly with a QHD screen too. It would be amazing if this phone was the combination of the S5 LTE-A and the metal chassis, but I get the feeling that''s slightly wishful thinking.</p><p>And if you want something a little smaller, then the  is here now as well. It''s a lot like the bigger brother, and the specs have only been dialled down slightly. It''s not quite got the raw power but the design aesthetic is there and the heartbeat monitor as well - well worth checking out if you don''t want to spend as much.</p><p>But enough of the competition: let''s look at one of the key questions that Samsung needed to answer with the Galaxy S5: is it good enough in market that''s becoming saturated with decent high-end handsets?</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/galaxys5-press-03-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 review"><figcaption>The water resistance will make a splash with a few buyers</figcaption></figure></p><p>The simple answer, from the second you hold it in the hand, is no &ndash; because the design simply isn''t up to the same level as the likes of Apple and HTC. That''s only a small part of the story though, and underneath the hood Samsung has continued its play of stuffing all the latest specs in and optimising them in a way that doesn''t suck down oodles of battery.</p><p>Is this phone good enough to keep Samsung fighting with Apple at the top of the sales charts? Yes, but that''s mostly through the impressive marketing machine that rolls out in every territory. Samsung needs this to be the last phone that rolls with such design language - the Galaxy S6 needs to be the dawn of a new age for the South Korean company, something to give consumers real lust for the way it looks.</p><p>Critically, it feels like there''s very little to shout about with the Galaxy S5 &ndash; but perhaps that''s no bad thing for a brand that was accused of bringing pointless innovation with last year''s model.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="zK46WzdBvonfb"></div><h3>Design</h3><p>I''ve always played it safe when talking about the design of a Samsung phone. The Galaxy S2, the brand''s first big hitter, was made mostly of plastic and still was one of our very few five star phones, after all.</p><p>That said, year after year, Samsung has failed to bring out something that wows where the rest of the competition has seen this as a key battleground. </p><p>HTC is the frontrunner here with the metal unibody design of the , and Apple has maintained its position at the sharp end of design ever since the launch of the iPhone 4.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p1060934-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 review"><figcaption>Happy as a phone in mud</figcaption></figure></p><p>Sony''s efforts with its Z range have culminated in the industrially designed , and even Nokia has been toying with aluminium to make things feel a little more premium.</p><p>All of this makes me curious: why is Samsung refusing to give the consumers what they want&hellip; namely, a metal chassis?</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p1060972-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 review"><figcaption>It''s plastic, not metal</figcaption></figure></p><p>There are a few possible reasons: cost of manufacture could be too high, especially at the volume Samsung spits them out at, Samsung likes to keep things lighter, waterproofing with a metal shell could have been trickier.</p><p>However, none of these arguments really holds water, given Apple does the same with a metallic phone, balanced handsets are better than lighter ones and Sony''s Xperia Z range has combined metal and water without a problem.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p1060964-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 review"><figcaption>A bright and clear screen</figcaption></figure></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a more solid phone than the Galaxy S4, that''s for sure, and looks more well-packaged thanks to the wider back and the grippier, pock-marked battery cover.</p><p>However, it doesn''t look like a cutting edge smartphone. It seems more akin to the product of a Galaxy Note 3 and the S4, with the metal-effect band around the outside subconsciously making me search for an S Pen.</p><p>The rear of the phone isn''t something that wows either. While I think the comparisons to a sticking plaster are a little cruel, it does share a more ''medical'' feel, especially in the white colour. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/201402231704082-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 review"><figcaption>Gold, white, black and blue</figcaption></figure></p><p>The blue and copper options are more attractive, but still don''t have anywhere near the appeal of the likes of the HTC One M8.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p1070037-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 review"><figcaption>White is particularly uninspiring, looking quite medical</figcaption></figure></p><p>With the larger screen on board, Samsung''s still managed to keep things well in proportion. Although the chassis is larger, it''s not unmanageably so, although if you''re coming from an iPhone, you might find it a little tricky to move up.</p><p>Those that have previously been fans of the Samsung Galaxy range before will find a lot to like here though. The home button &ndash; which now houses the fingerprint scanner, remember &ndash; is solid and easy to press, and the power key remains on the right-hand side of the phone, raised slightly and very easy to hit.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p1060999-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 review"><figcaption>The screen is clear even in daylight</figcaption></figure></p><p>The same can be said of the volume key on the right, although as the handset has increased in height I found it a little harder to get to this area when I wanted to change the level on music when walking along.</p><p>One of the key changes to the Galaxy S5 is the fact that it''s now water-resistant, with IP67 rating meaning you can dunk it water for a short while, although going swimming with it isn''t advised.</p><p>It''s also dust resistant too, which makes the uncovered headphone port all the more impressive as it makes the S5 much easier to use without having to pull open a flap to listen to some tunes.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p1060973-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 review"><figcaption>The water and dust cover is tricky to open</figcaption></figure></p><p>The USB 3.0 connection &ndash; which will look odd to some, but is the same used in the Galaxy Note 3 to give more power quickly while still allowing standard microUSB cables to be used &ndash; is covered to facilitate this IP rating, and it''s a little stiff to get off.</p><p>The groove to get your nail in to open it is quite small, and might be the only thing that irks those looking to get their hands on the best Galaxy phone and don''t care much about it being waterproof.</p><p>The capacitive buttons still flank the home key as before, but are slightly different now. Gone is the menu key, replaced by the multi-tasking button that seems to be Google''s new favourite in Android 4.4.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p1060968-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 review"><figcaption>The capacitive buttons have been tweaked</figcaption></figure></p><p>You can still use this as the menu key with a long press, but it doesn''t work intuitively and the distance from the right-hand side, where the right-handed will predominantly have their digits, is a little too far.</p><p>It''s not a bad system though, and the presence of a physical home button, while less necessary than before, still provides welcome tactility.</p><p>The other big design win Samsung still maintains with the Galaxy S5 is a removable battery. This is mostly for peace of mind nowadays, given that the battery life is so good on the S5, but if you''re worried about failure then this is a good option.</p><p>It also means the ugly FCC regulation stamp can be hidden from view, and you won''t need a SIM tool to get your card out &ndash; plus it''s easier to pop in a microSD card too.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p1060948-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 review"><figcaption>Muddy water still got in under the cover, but not into the port</figcaption></figure></p><p>The cover does give me slight cause for concern when you consider it from a water-resistant point of view, as it can be hard to make sure all the clips are securely fastened when snapping it back on.</p><p>A warning message does come up on the screen to remind you of this, but it can take a couple of passes to make sure it''s completely fixed on.</p><p>If you look under the battery cover, you''ll see that the battery is protected by a tight ring of rubber - if you''ve just dunked it in water, it''s a little disconcerting to see how much fluid is in the phone already... but this seems to be fine.</p><p>I did worryingly notice some grit got into the home key, but after an hour or two it seemed to dislodge itself, although it doesn''t make me think this phone is really that dustproof.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p1070032-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 review"><figcaption>Put it on stones, drizzle it in water. It''ll be fine.</figcaption></figure></p><p>Overall, the design of the Samsung Galaxy S5 is likely to be the area that receives the most criticism, and for good reason.</p><p>It doesn''t command a premium feel in the hand like so many other high-end phones on the market, and while some will point to how strong and high-quality the polycarbonate used is, it still pales in comparison to the competition.</p><p>Yes, it''s lighter and probably more hard-wearing (you''re much less likely to need a case with the Galaxy S5, for instance) but this is the biggest pain point for Samsung and it''s one that it needs to improve with the .</p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/galaxy-s5-adjust-160-80.jpg', ''),
(207, 'Moto G review', '&quot;A stunning phone for very little money - poorer camera aside, it''s the perfect PAYG phone. You won''t get a better budget blower than the Moto G.&quot;', ' <p><em>Update: We''ve spent some time with the Motorola Moto G 4G which, apart from the superfast connectivity, only differs in price and the inclusion of a microSD slot. We''ve updated our review to reflect the new model.</em></p><p>Motorola kicked off its global smartphone revival with the keenly priced Moto G handset, and it''s now available with 4G too in the form of the Moto G 4G.</p><p>The Moto G is a mid-range handset with a low-end price tag and  - enough to pique the interest of many savvy shoppers..</p><p>First things first then, the Motorola Moto G price. You can pick the 3G handset up in two storage sizes - 8GB and 16GB. The former will set you back just &pound;135/$175, while the larger size is still a very palatable &pound;159/$199.</p><p>And here''s some more good news: both Vodafone and Tesco Mobile in the UK have got the phone on offer, coming at &pound;100 (with a &pound;10 top up) for the former, and &pound;110 from the latter - man, that''s cheap for what you''re getting.</p><p>Motorola has enhanced the handset with the new Moto G 4G iteration, which is a little pricier coming in at &pound;149 - but does also pack in a microSD slot for some lovely storage expansion. </p><p>That price is for the 8GB model, as the Moto G 4G doesn''t have a 16GB variant.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motog-handson-13-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto G review"></figure></p><p>So where does this place the Moto G in the market? Well at that price it has the likes of the ,  and  for company, but dive into the spec list and you''ll note the Moto G wipes the floor with them.</p><p>In terms of design both the Moto G and Moto G 4G take most of their cues from the firm''s first, post-Google takeover handset, the .</p><p>It''s hardly groundbreaking in terms of looks, but the soft, curved edges of the Moto G make it relatively attractive and the swath of plastic feels solid and well built.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motog4g-handson-08-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto G review"></figure></p><p>Weighing in at 143g the Moto G has a pleasing, well balanced presence in the hand without being overbearing, and while it may measure 11.6mm thick in the middle the tapered edges make it feel thinner than it is.</p><p>Couple that with a rubberised rear plate which slightly hugs the side of the handset too, and the Motorola Moto G fits comfortably in the palm, providing a decent level of grip.</p><p>The Moto G features a water repellent coating which means you''ll be able to whip it out in the rain without fear of a short circuit, but it is not waterproof - so no jumping in the bath with it.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motog-handson-14-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto G review"></figure></p><p>You can even take the rear cover off and swap it for a different color, which Motorola is pushing as a big customizable feature of the phone. In reality however it just reminds me of my Nokia 3310.</p><p>Sure, changing covers is fun for all of five minutes, but the novelty soon wears off. Not to mention the back cover is also pretty tricky to remove - you need to really dig your nails in at the base of the handset to get it free.</p><p>In fact, so much strength needs to be employed to free the cover from the Moto G I feared on more than one occasion that the thin plastic would snap - thankfully it never did.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motog4g-handson-01-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto G review"></figure></p><p>Motorola did make a point that the younger generation like the ability to "customize" their handsets and this particular feature, along with the rock bottom price, reinforces the Moto G''s credentials as a handset which may land in the laps of many teenagers.</p><p>Something worth noting is that because the Moto G and Moto G 4G are identical is design and size you can switch covers between the two variants.</p><p>The left side of the Motorola Moto G is devoid of any features, while the top of the handset only sports a centralized headphone jack. Both the power/lock key and volume rocker switch are located on the right of the G and these are easy to reach and responsive to the press.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motog-handson-19-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto G review"></figure></p><p>On the base is a microUSB port, while under the removable cover the only physical difference between the Moto G 4G and Moto G can be found. </p><p>Open up the 3G enabled Moto G and you''ll spy a microSIM port on the side towards the top of the handset- but no microSD slot.</p><p>Now take a look at the Moto G 4G, and the microSIM port has changed to a microSD slot, with the new SIM location in the bottom corner of the handset.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motog4g-handson-09-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto G review"></figure></p><p>The 2070mAh non-removable battery housed inside the Moto G is claimed to give you all day battery life, and I put that to the test - skip ahead to the battery life and connectivity section to see how it got on.</p><p>The Moto G comes with a 4.5-inch, 1280 x 720 display and boasts a 329ppi pixel density. To put that in some perspective that''s a bigger, higher resolution and more defined display than the  - not bad for a handset which is a third of the price.</p><p>Of course a HD display isn''t the only key factor in a smartphone, but Motorola has managed to equip the Moto G 4G and G with a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor and 1GB of RAM.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motog4g-handson-04-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto G review"></figure></p><p>In terms of specs then the Motorola Moto G is actually giving the ,  and  a run for their mid-range, dual-core money - and once again the screen is bigger than these rivals.

(208, 'Huawei Ascend G6 review', '&quot;A solid offering in terms of design and value, the Huawei Ascend G6 is let down by unreliable usability and a custom UI that will divide opinion. Up against tough competition, there are better handsets available at this price.&quot;', ' <p>Huawei made a lot of noise last year launching its then-flagship , boasting that at 6.2mm thick it was the thinnest phone available at the time. </p><p>A year later, the Chinese company is back with a scaled-down version called the Ascend G6, which it hopes will appeal to budget conscious customers. </p><p>Going up against other budget Android handsets like the  or the  is a big ask these days, but the Ascend G6 is not without a few headline features of its own.</p><p>First up: Connectivity. Specifically, I''m talking about 4G. Huawei has built the Ascend G6 with 4G compatibility, something which is just beginning to arrive on handsets under &pound;250. </p><p>Motorola added 4G for the Moto G 4G handset that comes in at &pound;150 and the  (coincidentally manufactured by Huawei itself) offers 4G, albeit locked to EE, at only &pound;100. Likewise, the 4G-capable  will set you back around &pound;230 SIM-free. The Ascend G6 though, boasts CAT 4 version of the technology, which is the fastest connection available so far. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/huawei20ascend20g620hands20on203-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Huawei Ascend G6 review"></figure></p><p>Secondly, Huawei is looking to tap into the selfie crowd by equipping the Ascend G6 with a front-facing 5MP camera. Which is the same spec as the Moto G''s main rear-facing camera. So, if you''re fond of snapping yourself and need the fastest data connection possible &ndash; this should be the phone for you, right?</p><p>The good news is that the Ascend G6 is, design-wise, about as inoffensive as a smartphone can get. Like its big brother, the Ascend P6, there''s more than a whiff of Apple''s  about it &ndash; thanks largely to the faux-metal strip running along the outside of the chassis.</p><p>The 4.5-inch, 960 x 540 LCD display is bordered by a fairly sizable bezel that is most noticeable at the bottom where a plastic lip protrudes beneath the Android soft-touch navigation keys. The lip is where you''ll find the small fingernail slot that lets you prise away the removable plastic back plate.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/huawei20ascend20g620hands20on2028729-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Huawei Ascend G6 review"></figure></p><p>Beneath this there''s space for the microSIM and microSD card, as well as the non-removable 2000mAh battery. When the phone is in one piece it tips the scales at only 115g and measures 130 x 65 x 7.5mm. </p><p>In real-world terms, this means it''s a good size for one-handed operation and neither too heavy nor too light thanks to the plastic casing.</p><p>On the right hand side are the physical volume rocker keys and the on/off power switch. Unlike most other handsets, the microUSB port can be found on the top of the device, while the 3.5mm headphone jack is located at the bottom on the left hand side of the chassis. </p><p>I did find this beneficial when using headphones as the natural movement is to put the phone head-first into your pocket which, in this case, means less tangled headphone wires.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/huawei20ascend20g620hands20on2019-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Huawei Ascend G6 review"></figure></p><p>A small speaker grill is built into the bottom left of the rear of the phone while the camera lens and flash are above it, tucked into the top left. </p><p>Unfortunately, these particular placements can cause a bit of a problem when holding the phone in landscape mode as I found on occasion my fingers would cover the speaker when watching a video or slightly obscure the lens when taking a picture. </p><p>A more sensible design would be that of the  with front-facing speakers and a camera lens placed more centrally.</p><p>Huawei has done a better job of placement on the front of the phone with the camera lens again tucked up in the left hand corner, which makes it easy to quickly snap a one handed selfie. A small green light also appears on the right of the Huawei logo to let you know if you have an email, text message or notification that needs addressing.</p><p>Powering the Ascend G6 is a reasonable ARM 1.2GHz quad-core processor backed with 1GB of RAM. While the operating system is Google''s Android 4.3 Jelly Bean (no KitKat here), Huawei has overlaid it with the same Emotion UI that featured on last year''s Ascend P6 and again on the newly released . </p><p>The result is a rather more cutesy tone with some extra homegrown features thrown in that I''ll address in more detail later.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/huawei20ascend20g620hands20on2023-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Huawei Ascend G6 review"></figure></p><p>The aforementioned microSD card is an absolute necessity as Huawei has only loaded the Ascend G6 with 4GB of native storage space. Space that will, as expected, fill up fast when you start loading on media and downloading apps.</p><p>In terms of first impressions, the Huawei Ascend G6 doesn''t cut a bad figure. But I would say that the rather mature outward design of the handset jars slightly with the childish Emotion UI. Considering the price and the bracket in which the Ascend G6 falls though, it''s difficult to find fault with the way the phone looks and the level of hardware that Huawei has built into it. </p><p>But how does it hold up once it''s out of the box and working in the real world? It''s a mixed bag, read on and I''ll tell you why.</p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/huaweiascendg6hero-160-80.jpg', ''),
(209, 'LG G2 Mini review', '&quot;With the G2 Mini, LG provides most of the experience of the G2 but in a smaller and cheaper package. It has equally amazing battery life and most of the software enhancements but sacrifices on screen quality.&quot;', ' <p>There has never been a better time to be shopping in the middle or low end of the smartphone market. Whereas a few years ago any device at this level would be very slow, have a tiny screen, a very poor camera and weak battery life, LG is once again proving with the G2 Mini that times have changed.</p><p>None of this is to say that the G2 Mini is an especially cheap smartphone, although at just over the &pound;200 mark off contract it is hardly expensive. Motorola is doing amazing things with its  and Nokia has the  both of which undercut the G2 Mini by a fair chunk.</p><p>Given LG''s standing as potentially the most innovative and improved manufacturer of 2013, the G2 Mini deserves a fair look despite its relatively high price compared to its peers.</p><p>LG has carried over the most unusual and unique aspects of the  into its lower end offering, most notably the buttons on the back. It is an unusual placement but does make sense given that they sit just where your fingers often are when holding the phone normally.</p><p>It takes a little time to get used to the buttons being on the back, but after a few days I found it quite natural to use them. I don''t particularly find they offer an improved experience over well-placed buttons on the side of a phone, but they are not a hindrance either.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/h1-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G2 Mini review"></figure></p><p>The main benefit of this unusual button layout is that the bezels to the sides of the screen can be extremely small. LG showed everyone just how small bezels can be on the G2 and has largely carried off the same trick with the G2 Mini.</p><p>It is not quite as impressive this time, but it makes the phone noticeably smaller than others with similar screen sizes.</p><p>Other than the buttons, the design of the G2 Mini is fairly standard with its headphone jack up top and the microUSB charging port at the bottom flanked by two speaker grilles although there is only one speaker actually in the device.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/h3-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G2 Mini review"></figure></p><p>While the bezels around the screen are small, the display itself is a very comfortable 4.7 inches in size and is an IPS display meaning that viewing angles are largely superb. </p><p>LG has skimped on the resolution though. While phones like the  have a 720p display sporting 1280 x 720 pixels, the G2 Mini only has a qHD resolution, which is 960 x 540 pixels. </p><p>The low resolution is not quite as bad as it may sound on paper, but it is noticeable and fine text can be tough to read. The screen quality is good it just needs more pixels.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/h2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G2 Mini review"></figure></p><p>Unlike some devices at a similar price, LG has kept the G2 Mini''s waistline in check and it is just 9.8mm thick.</p><p>Another attribute of the G2 that LG has carried over to the G2 Mini is the unusually large battery for size of device with a 2440mAh power cell sitting behind that removable back cover.</p><p>Inside, LG has fitted the G2 Mini with everything you would expect at this price point.

The G2 Mini has no light sensor, there is just a front facing camera above the screen, and therefore no auto-brightness control for the screen. </p><p>Unlike most handsets at this end of the smartphone market, the G2 Mini has a decent camera on board. It is an 8MP sensor with an LED flash to help in dark conditions that is able to produce some very nice photos. A 1.3MP front facing camera is there for those all-important selfies too.</p><p>The icing on the cake is that the G2 Mini supports LTE as well delivering the usual high speed internet that any experienced user of 4G would recognise.</p><p>On paper then the G2 Mini stacks up well, but given that Motorola has got the LTE model of its superb Moto G on sale at &pound;159 off contract, the LG does look a little expensive, despite some extra capabilities on the imaging side.</p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/lgg2minihero-160-80.jpg', '');

(210, 'LG G3 review', '&quot;A great handset that''s more phablet than phone - and it''s only slightly let down by lackluster design.&quot;', ' <p>With the LG G3, we''re seeing a brand release a phone ahead of time in order to grab a foothold in an industry that could be spiralling away from its grasp.</p><p>It''s an odd thing to say considering we''re talking about a manufacturer that launched one of the critically acclaimed phones of 2013, with the  impressing far more than most expected.</p><p>But that was months ago, and LG has realised that with Samsung, Sony and HTC all bringing out far superior models it can''t wait until later in the year to catch up, so it''s tried to race to the front of the pack with a previously-unseen step forward in screen technology.</p><p>If you need more evidence that this is a phone that LG has accelerated to launch, check out the changes it''s made: removable battery, microSD slot, metallic frame and new, mature interface; in short, everything that was wrong with last year''s model in the eyes of many.</p><p>So with that in mind, is the LG G3 the perfect smartphone?</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="u8BX3Mc9yp7lD"></div><h3>Key features</h3><p>There are a number of key features that LG is touting as new and improved this year with the G3, but none sticks out as prominently as the QHD screen. Some might think that this is four times the pixel count of an HD screen, and you''d be right to a degree.</p><p>But only if you''re talking about 720p screens &ndash; if you''re comparing the G3 to something like the Galaxy S5, that packs in two million pixels to the G3''s 3.6 million. It''s a lot sharper, sure, but anyone thinking it''s going to be mindblowing will be disappointed.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/lgg3review205-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G3 review"></figure></p><p>The big question here with the screen is: why do it? The official reason LG told me was it had done some research and had realised that Steve Jobs was wrong. </p><p>While it agreed he was right there was a limit to what the human eye can see in terms of sharpness, LG reckons that the way sight works means the Retina display isn''t the top end. That''s obvious anyway; the display on the  or  is significantly sharper than that on the , so there is more headroom.</p><p>But apparently there''s another level <em>still</em> to attack, and that''s just what it''s done with the QHD screen. Where Samsung''s offering 440ppi sharpness, the G3 has 538ppi, which is equivalent to high end glossy art books, which LG used as the benchmark of sharpness to aim at. </p><p>Dr RamChan Woo, head of smartphone planning for LG, told me that the idea was you need pixels to fill in the space between lines, to make something that sorts out the ''dead space'', which is why it went for the upper limit to make everything look premium.</p><p>Now, here''s the quandary: the screen is brilliant, no question. Internet browsing, looking at pictures, watching high-end video, is all awesome. But that''s the exact same feeling I had with the G2, which also had a simply stunning screen.</p><p>It feels like the QHD screen is great to look at because LG knows how to make an amazing display, rather that offering a next level of sharpness that blows me away. I didn''t feel that I was looking at something superior to the G2 in terms of screen quality, and with the larger heft and hit on battery life, I believe LG has gone too early with the technology just to make an impact.</p><p>Or possibly its not even early. Perhaps we just don''t need QHD screens in our phones. The display isn''t without problems either: tilt it left or right and the brightness drops off sharply, which makes sense when you consider how many pixels are packed in there.</p><p>It''s unfair to criticise the QHD screen on the G3 &ndash; there''s no doubt all high end smartphones will be using this technology in a year or so. But as a headline spec, it doesn''t seem to add a huge amount to the G3, which is a shame as I was hoping to be looking at the next generation of picture quality on a phone.</p><h3>New interface</h3><p>When it came to listing the criticisms of the LG G2, the biggest problem was the interface. It was so cluttered that if you had the remote activated and received a message you had to scroll down to see it.</p><p>Compare that to the HTC One M8, and you''ve got nothing but the missive to check. On top of that, the G2 went for a really garish and cartoony look too, meaning it was hard to evangelise on a phone that was otherwise brilliant.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/lgg3review-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G3 review"></figure></p><p>The new interface on the LG G3 is a big improvement. Gone is the skeumorphism in favour of a new flat tile look. The icons are redesigned. The different applications have their own colour scheme for easy recognition and the colour palette is more muted than before.</p><p>It''s a much more fluid system that shows LG has grown up, taking the problems of before and making it into a more intuitive way of navigating through the handset.</p><p>LG has definitely taken touches from HTC, Samsung and Apple with the new interface. The home screen features a separate section for the pedometer and tips videos (where Samsung''s pointless magazine option is on the Galaxy S5), the colours are very similar to HTC''s on the M8 and the flatter design owes more than a tip of the hat to Apple.</p><p>The interface is still a little cluttered, but overall it''s a tick for LG updating something that sorely needed a new look.</p><h3>Metallic shell</h3><p>As mentioned the other big problem with the G2 was the fact it had a really glossy plastic shell. The phone was well packaged, but still didn''t offer the same premium quality as the HTC One, iPhone or Sony Xperia Z1.</p><p>So with the LG G3, the South Korean brand has gone for the best of both worlds. It''s created a ''metallic skin'' that supposedly looks and feels premium, but offers the lower weight and added connectivity benefits of polycarbonate.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/lgg3review203-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G3 review"><figcaption>It might look similar, but the feel in the hand is very different</figcaption></figure></p><p>The problem is, LG hasn''t really managed this lofty goal. The G3 certainly looks the business, bringing a more iconic look of brushed metal and some cool colours (black, silver and gold) to make it stand out on the shelves, which makes sense given it''s mostly screen otherwise.</p><p>But the second you pick it up, the plastic nature jars with the look of the phone, which is a disappointment. It actually feels cheaper than the G2 thanks to using a removable back, which lowers the tightness of the packaging and makes it feel more hollow.</p><p>The upside of this is you''ve got a removable battery and microSD slot, both of which are a big win for a certain section of the customer base. That said, there are better ways of doing this, as you can easily have a slot for a microSD card without needing to remove the back.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/lgg3review209-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G3 review"><figcaption>The battery and back cover are both removable</figcaption></figure></p><p>And I know a few people disagree, but a unibody phone feels better in the hand and a portable battery pack is much more useful than being able to swap in a new battery - it''s easier to charge, for one, and 98% of users will never swap the battery in and out anyway, so why bother when an integrated unit can offer more capacity and better design?</p><p>So again, LG has stepped forward with the G3 &ndash; but it''s still not quite got all the pieces together when it comes to design.</p><h3>Simple camera with laser autofocus</h3><p>The 13MP camera on the LG G3 is also another big talking point, both in terms of the new look to the interface and the additional technology on board.</p><p>I''ll start with the latter point: the laser auto focus, which is designed to make it the fastest-focusing smartphone on the market. It seems to be true at times, but I''m not sure shaving another 100 milliseconds off makes that much of a difference when boot-up speed is more important..</p><p>It''s possibly a bit unfair to say that the extra speed isn''t warranted &ndash; if the system worked perfectly, chances are you''d take 10-20 more high quality pictures that capture the moment compared to the competition, but without being able to fully test the system it''s hard to comment.</p><p>The laser works by sending out a conical infra-red signal (using technology nabbed from a robo-vacuum cleaner from LG''s home appliances division) and absorbs information from the surroundings to create an instant and clear picture for the camera to use. </p><p>This means it doesn''t have to look for contrast shifts like before, and offers a sharper image.</p><p>The interface is really scaled back too: it''s nothing more than a back button, a menu icon and the viewfinder. Tap the screen and it focuses and takes the picture, designed to be simple and effective.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/lgg3review2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G3 review"></figure></p><p>It also doesn''t let you focus to check the shot composition before taking the photo, which would be nice &ndash; but then again, tap that menu icon and you get all you need in terms of shutter, options and video recording.</p><p>The G3 is all about simplification, and this kind of technology really works. It''s a little <em>too </em>scaled back for the camera, but it''s the right idea.</p><p>The front 2.1MP camera is now cringingly called the ''selfie'' camera &ndash; it seems that dreaded word is here to stay, at least for a few years. The lens is a wider angle, so you can get more friends into the photo (or more actors at the Oscars) and features clever gesture recognition to take the photo.</p><p>Hold your hand out, make a fist and it''ll start the G3 self-portrait timer. It''s a clever system and it works, which is great for those moments when you can''t use both hands and don''t want to tap the screen.</p><p>Another cool feature is the ability to have a front-facing flash, although it''s not an LED light. Instead, part of the screen goes white, which illuminates faces and takes better pictures. LG has even white balanced this screen to correct skin tone imperfections &ndash; and it really gives some nice front facing snaps.</p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/lgg3review2011-160-80.jpg', ''),
(211, 'Sony Xperia Z1 review', '&quot;It''s a Range Rover for the school run. A gold toilet seat. Having all the sport and film channels on a telly in the shed. You''ll feel awesome with one in your pocket, but for an all-round device, it feels like Sony has dropped the ball on design and screen technology and gambled too hard on camera - a move that didn''t pay off fully.&quot;', ' <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Sony has now upgraded the Xperia Z1 to run on Google''s Android 4.4.2  release. We''ve updated the review again to reflect this.</p><p>Sony was the first of the big-name manufacturers to launch a new 2013 flagship smartphone back in March of last year, with the , a 5-inch model outwardly rather similar to the new Sony Xperia Z1.</p><p>The Xperia Z beat the  and  to market, offering a quad-core processor, 1080p display, 13MP camera, 2GB of RAM, and water and dust resistance. It was awesome. </p><p>But a new Sony flagship arrvied for the autumn/winter 2013 season, in the large, glossy shape of the Xperia Z1. There''s a more powerful processor inside, a higher-spec camera and a new metal chassis, but it''s still recognisably related to the older Z, both in design terms and the software it runs.</p><p>It''s a premium model too. The Z1 launched last year for a stonking great &pound;599 in the UK, and even though it''s just been usurped by the all-new , it''s still a hugely expensive phone with an unlocked price of around &pound;479.</p><p>As with the Xperia Z, the Z1''s 5-inch screen displays at full HD 1920 x 1080 resolution. The key upgrades here are hidden inside, with the Z1 powered by a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chipset clocked at 2.2GHz and backed up by the same 2GB of working RAM as the Z.</p><p>There''s also an upgraded aluminium chassis that rounds off the sharp edges of the Z in favour of a gentler, colder, metallic feel. The headline feature is the 20.7MP camera sensor, on paper a vast upgrade over the 13MP unit inside the older Z.</p><p><br><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/xperiaz1-press-01-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z1 review"></figure></p><p>The Z1 is certified to IP standards for dust and water resistance, so ought to be 100% impervious to the more mundane threat of pocket fluff.</p><p>Indeed, the phone''s ports - microSD, USB and micro-SIM - are all hidden behind rubber stoppers, to keep water, dust and fluff at bay.</p><p>The Z1''s 3.5mm headphone jack is open to the elements on the top-left corner of the phone, so Sony''s done a bit of useful work here to waterproof that and do away with the rubber stopper.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/hands-10-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="stylus and tablet"></figure></p><p>I thought the addition of a flap over the USB connector would be a first-world problem-causing frustration on a daily basis, but thankfully I was wrong.</p><p>It pops out easily. It pops back in easily. It''s a second and a half worth investing each day in return for a fully waterproof phone.</p><p> <object width="580" height="356"> <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/sX6MNT3Tb-c&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/sX6MNT3Tb-c&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="580" height="356"></embed> </object> </p><p>Holding the Sony Xperia Z1 is a treat to the senses too, as the Z1 features a full glass exterior as well as a smooth, featureless and button-free front.</p><p>The back''s so shiny you could mistake it for a display, albeit a broken display that''s stuck showing the Sony logo in the middle.</p><p>Sony''s designers have ensured that the Z1''s plastic sides extend by a fraction of a millimetre over the phone''s glassy rear.</p><p>This acts as a shock absorber and means the glass should be protected from casual tosses onto hard surfaces - although I''ve scratched the back a little already. But that was probably from chucking it in the sea to check its water resistance, so I have only myself to blame.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/hands-8-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Side view"><figcaption>The Z1 is cool to the touch</figcaption></figure></p><p>It feels big and wide, although thanks to also being rather tall as well it manages to balance pretty nicely in the hand. It''s also cool to the touch, with the aluminium sides giving your hand the odd chill when it''s been out on a table for a while.</p><p>Sony''s also stuck with its idea of putting the power button on the side of the phone a little above the middle, meaning it''s easy to find and naturally appears where your fingers tend to sit when holding a phone of this size.</p><p>But being so slim and smooth has you worrying. Putting it in a pocket makes you stress that it''s so slick it''s surely only a matter of time before it somehow works itself up and out onto the floor.</p><p>But that''s not happened to me yet. I am probably just worrying too much. It encourages you to worry, as it''s such a large lump of a phone you''re always aware of its presence.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/hands-7-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Hands"><figcaption>Just about possible to hold in one hand</figcaption></figure></p><p>Thanks to the positioning of the power button it is just about possible to use the Xperia Z1 in one hand. It''s not entirely comfortable to hold, though, as the angular slab design and glass back has you panicking that it''s a very droppable item.</p><p>Your fingers end up seeking out the docking port as the only gripping spot, as that''s the only feature on the left-hand side of the Z1 that isn''t completely smooth and flush.</p><p>The front... no, wait, this is the back. The back looks like the front. It''s all glass and smooth, although I suspect it''s not made from stuff as tough as that which covers the front, as a fair few tiny scratches have developed in a little over a week of use.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/hands-6-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Rear shot"><figcaption>The back looks like the front</figcaption></figure></p><p>The right-hand edge features the microSIM card tray - which can be pulled out with a fingernail - power button, volume up/down toggle and the camera shutter button, the latter of which can be used to open up the camera by holding it down for a second or so.</p><p>The SIM tray is peculiar, housing an impossibly flimsy piece of plastic that''s used to insert the SIM, which is so thin it''s bordering on paper-like. If you''re a regular SIM-swapper it''ll be a nightmare, as this teeny holder is definitely one of the few weak spots in the Z1''s design.</p><p>The left-hand side has the microSD slot and USB connectors, which sit above the docking station pins, while the bottom edge is all speaker grill.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/hands-4-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Front"><figcaption>Well-positioned buttons make holding easier</figcaption></figure></p><p>It''s not the best place for a speaker as, what with this being such a huge phone, you often end up supporting it with a finger or thumb while using it - blocking or at least changing the level of the audio when simply adjusting your grip. Not a massive flaw, but a minor annoyance all the same.</p><p>The bottom of the display is allocated for Android''s software buttons, which are presented here in standard Back, Home and the Recent Apps multitasking button.</p><p>There''s enough chin beneath the display to ensure these software buttons aren''t too low down the Z1''s body, again helping to make one-handed use a little easier. No mean feat when dealing with a 5-inch monster.</p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/xperiaz1-press-160-80.jpg', ''),
(212, 'ZTE Open C review', '&quot;Budget hardware from ZTE and a fledgling OS from Firefox do not make for a great partnership.

(214, 'Sony Xperia M2 review', '&quot;The Xperia M2 faces some serious opposition in the mid-range market. Its battery life is impressive, as is the design of the UI and handset. The camera disappoints, as do a few other features, but overall it manages to hold its own.&quot;', ' <p>Given the critical acclaim that the newly launched  has received, it is vital that Sony follows up with equally impressive mid range handsets if it is to compete with Apple and Samsung. Enter the Sony Xperia M2.</p><p>Not too long ago it seemed that Sony might have been out of the mobile running. Shoot forward to 2014 and Sony has established itself at the top, although the Japanese firm has yet to firmly prove itself with a truly decent midrange handset. Could things be about to change with the Xperia M2?</p><p>At first glance the Xperia M2 seems like a respectable proposition; a quad-core processor, 8MP camera and 4G LTE support, wrapped in a chassis that looks oddly familiar all for &pound;230 (about $385, AU$415) or free on two year contracts starting at around &pound;13 per month.</p><p>This means that the Sony handset has a tough fight on its hands, facing off against the newly relaunched 4G , as well as the ,  and the , all of which come in with a similarly low price tag.</p><p>The competition is fierce then, but with the same Sony Omnibalance design aesthetics that has graced its recent flagships the Xperia M2 certainly stands out. This could really help the M2 succeed where the  failed.</p><p>Sony could be criticised for its almost minimalist approach, but I have grown fond of the more industrial design nature that accompanies Sony handsets.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/xperia-m2-black-1240x840-60271196b119d9cf8cac50e166e7c71f-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia M2 review"></figure></p><p>The large 4.8-inch screen dominates proceedings, packed with 540 x 960 pixels. This seems a little disappointing as the 229ppi pixel desnity is by no means razor sharp, although I never found the lack of pixels to be too much of a sticking point.</p><p>It should be noted though that the 4.5-inch Moto G comes in with a HD 720 x 1280 screen, so would be a better choice for those intent on watching a lot of movies or for heavy mobile gamers.</p><p>Back to the design I feel that the language of the Xperia M2 is far more reminiscent of the original Xperia Z flagship, albeit one fashioned out of plastic rather than glass and metal.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/dsci0042-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia M2 review"></figure></p><p>The plastic construction helps to keep the weight of the 139.7 x 71.1 x 8.6mm frame down to only 148g, although the M2 still has a reassuring heft behind it.</p><p>Over the course of my time with the Sony Xperia M2 though, I found that the shiny plastic back was extremely prone to fingerprints and it wasn''t long before minor scratches became noticeable.</p><p>Along the base of the M2 you''ll find the external speaker in the same place as on the . Those with a good memory will remember that this was a bit of a problem for the Z, especially when watching movies.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/dsci0019-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia M2 review"></figure></p><p>Although Sony has taken note of this and corrected it on the , the problem persists here. Being seated at the bottom means that holding the M2 in landscape for movie watching causes the sound to feel distorted coming in just one ear.</p><p>While in portrait for gaming I found that my thumb was covering the speaker giving a heavily muffled sound.</p><p>Elsewhere the Sony design is evident with the large power/lock key sat in the middle of the right side of the Xperia M2, with the microSIM and microSD slots hidden at the top end behind a small plastic cover. The volume rocker and dedicated camera button sit towards the bottom.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/dsci0034-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia M2 review"></figure></p><p>Hiding the SIM and SD slot might appear to be a hint that the Xperia M2 has taken notes from its bigger brother in terms of water and dust resistance, although this isn''t the case. I found this very disappointing, as it would certainly have given the M2 an edge over its nearest rivals.</p><p>On the other side of the handset is an uncovered microUSB port leaving the headphone port to sit along the top.</p><p>Interestingly there is a notification light that shows up just to the left of the speaker. This illuminates while the M2 is on charge, as well as when you have a text message. However I found that it only lit up once rather than repetitively and is so small it''s almost unnoticeable.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/dsci0028-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia M2 review"></figure></p><p>At the base of the screen is another light, very discretely hidden. This light seems even more pointless as the only time I saw it light up was when a call was coming in, and given that the M2 spent most of its time in my pocket it wasn''t seen.</p><p>Packed behind the screen is a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor backed up with 1GB RAM and 8GB of internal storage.</p><p>Despite the microSD support I was disappointed to find that only 5GB of the internal space was accessible. A 2300mAh battery is also included to power the M2.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/dsci0036-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia M2 review"></figure></p><p>An 8MP camera has been fitted to the back, carrying the same app features that can be found on the Xperia Z range. Round the front is a far more modest VGA camera for those desperate to take a self-portrait.</p><p> On paper the Sony Xperia M2 paints an interesting picture for itself, but the specs can only ever paint half the picture. Can the M2 live up to these high expectations?</p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/xperiam2-press-01-160-80.jpg', ''),

It''s full of new features and a step up from anything Nokia has had to offer in the entry level Windows Phone category so far.&quot;', ' <p>With the  now the world''s top-selling  handset, it''s no surprise that Nokia and Microsoft are concentrating on strengthening their low-budget range as it tries to dominate an area of the market. </p><p>The Nokia Lumia 630 is the first Windows Phone to arrive straight out of the box with .</p><p>Price-wise the Lumia 630 slots into the bottom end of the range just above the Lumia 520, but it comes jam-packed with features thanks to the upgraded operating system, therefore you get a lot more bang for your buck. </p><p>Windows Phone 8.1 offers a lot more upgrades and additions than you would expect from the usual ''point upgrade'', it''s almost a complete overhaul of its predecessor.</p><p>All of the desirable features of Windows Phone 8 remain, however the upgrade pushes the OS closer to its competitors iOS and Android, replicating their existing features with the likes of the new Word Flow Keyboard and Action Centre. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/imag0696-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 630 review"></figure></p><p>Other additions to the new Windows Phone system are all focused on putting the smart back into smartphone as it focuses on getting you the most out of your features.</p><p>Data Sense and Wi-Fi Sense look to take the hassle out of data usage and Wi-Fi connection. The new ClearBlack screen allows you to enjoy the new entertainment features and apps available, including Xbox games.</p><p>The Nokia Lumia 630 also has new internal hardware ready to take advantage of the SensorCore SDK announced at Build 2014 so it can essentially act as your personal pedometer and measurement tool, because who doesn''t take their phone everywhere they go.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/imag0688-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 630 review"></figure></p><p>The operating system isn''t the only upgrade on the Lumia 630; it also has a generous 4.5-inch ClearBlack, 480 x 854 display, 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 processor and 512MB of RAM, beating out both the  and .</p><p>All that is not too shabby considering you can pick up the Nokia Lumia 630 for &pound;129 SIM-free or free if you buy it locked on a PAYG deal from &pound;9.50 per month. A dual-SIM variant will also be available but exact pricing is currently unavailable.</p><p>Although it''s certainly an improvement on previous low-end Lumia''s, there are still some features missing that you might expect. The Nokia Lumia 630 still doesn''t have NFC, a camera flash or a front-facing snapper so if those are must-haves then this isn''t the phone for you.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/imag0698-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 630 review"></figure></p><p>However, if you can live without those then it''s not bad for the bargain price.</p><p>Statement colour is the cornerstone of the Nokia Lumia range and the Lumia 630 is no exception. The Nokia Lumia 630 has a removable, and therefore interchangeable, case so you can switch from the outspoken and fun bright green, bright yellow and bright orange to a more understated and professional black or white case. </p><p>The removable case also allows for easier access to the battery and SIM card so you won''t be scrambling for a safety pin to get to the SIM (let''s face it, you''ll inevitably lose the actual tool for the job). </p><p>It also makes the Lumia 630 feel lighter and less bulky and allows for a larger screen than previous designs due to a smaller bezel. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/imag0680-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 630 review"></figure></p><p>The Nokia Lumia 630 is more rectangular and less smoothly finished than most of its competitors, however it has a strong and eye-catching design that follows the line of the higher-end Nokia''s like the .</p><p>Its change in design makes it slimmer than the  and  at just 9.2mm. Yet the increased screen size makes it heavier at 134g and wider at 129.5 x 66.7mm. This alongside the rectangular design does mean it feels quite wide in the hand, so I wouldn''t recommend it if you have small, delicate hands. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/imag0648-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 630 review"></figure></p><p>Although the shell is removable, as with other Lumias it is a strong enough case that you don''t need anything in addition. You can still customise the design to an extent &ndash; case manufacturers are bound to already be beavering away on alternative designs. </p><p>The front of the Nokia Lumia 630 is mostly screen and a good sized one at that for such a low-priced design. At 271 pixels per inch it''s certainly not the best quality screen you''ll find out there but for the price, what more can you expect?</p><p>You can also use gloves with it, which is becoming more common but it''s a great selling point, or it will be in the winter at least. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/imag0636-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 630 review"></figure></p><p>Although the screen is sizeable, it isn''t edge-to-edge. There''s a black border running the entire way around it. The border becomes wider at the top to allow for the Nokia logo, ear and mouth pieces and at the bottom where you''ll find the star, back and search soft-keys.</p><p>The back of the Nokia Lumia 630 is very simple with just a small loudspeaker, the 5MP camera lens near the top and of course the small Nokia logo in the centre.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/imag0668-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 630 review"></figure></p><p>The right edge of the handset houses all of the phone''s physical buttons, with a volume rocker and the power button just below it. The signature camera button has been removed which is a shame as it was an added bonus on previous Nokia devices. </p><p>The left edge is completely free of any features, ports or buttons at all. The top is home only to a 3.5mm headphone port on the left-hand side and the bottom edge has a micro USB port in the centre, which is used for charging or connecting the Nokia Lumia 630 to a computer.</p><p>The back cover is easy to remove &ndash; you simply use your nails to peel it away at each corner. The cover is suitably strong enough and therefore unlikely to snap even if you''re changing it every five minutes. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/imag0702-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 630 review"></figure></p><p>Once that has been removed, you''ll have access to the 1830mAh battery, which is bigger than the  and 620. </p><p>Beneath the battery there are two slots &ndash; one for a micro SIM card and one for a microSD card. The Nokia Lumia 630 supports up to 128GB cards, which is useful for extending the fairly limited 8GB of on-board memory and 7GB OneDrive cloud storage. </p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/imag0701-160-80.jpg', ''),

The P7 now has its USB connector at the bottom of the device, making it much easier to hold the thing in front of your face when it''s plugged in and charging. </p><p>The headphone socket has also been shifted, now sitting right at the top of the phone instead of the ridiculous side placement Huawei employed with the previous P6.</p><p>These tweaks alone make it a much more usable phone on a physical level, plus the lightness of the Ascend P7 and the slim bezel makes it feel substantially smaller in the hand than the likes of the  or chunky . </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p7-hands-7-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Huawei Ascend P7 review"></figure></p><p>There''s a bespoke little pin in the box, for users to poke-eject the microSIM and SD card trays from their docks. Huawei suggested there was dual-SIM capability in the Ascend P7 at its launch, with a second SIM supposedly able to sit in the SD card slot if you value connectivity over storage space. </p><p>But this feature wasn''t available for us, as there was no way to get a second SIM - micro or nano - securely in place. We suspect there''s a low-profile dual-SIM hardware version out there in other countries, as this variant of the P7 only allows one SIM to be used. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/p7-hands-5-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Huawei Ascend P7 review"></figure></p><p>Power and volume button placement is a bit fiddly.

The back is a little slippery, which makes it harder to get a good grip.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motoe-handson-08-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto E review"></figure></p><p>Speaking of the back, the Moto E is plastic, as you''d expect given the price, and it''s also fairly plain and featureless, aside from the 5MP camera lens.</p><p>My review handset came with a black cover, which gives the phone a smart, classy look. But there are nine different shells available, so if black''s not your thing there are other options.</p><p>As the cover is removable you can also swap it for a new one at a later date if you ever want a change or if yours gets damaged, though as plastic covers go it feels fairly sturdy. I did find it slightly tricky to get off, so it''s a good thing that you shouldn''t need to do so very often.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motoe-handson-17-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto E review"></figure></p><p>Under the cover you''ll find the micro SIM slot and a microSD card slot with support for cards of up to 32GB. The 1920mAh battery is also visible, but it almost felt like it was taunting me as despite being able to get to it the power pack isn''t removable.</p><p>There isn''t much in the way of buttons or sensors to be found on the Moto E. The right edge is home to the power button and volume rocker, which are both easy to hit and have a pleasing metallic look.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motoe-handson-11-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto E review"></figure></p><p>The top edge has the headphone jack, while the bottom has a micro USB charging port. On the front you''ll find a speaker below the 4.3-inch IPS screen, while the earpiece and a notification LED are above it.</p><p>You might have noticed that I haven''t mentioned a front-facing camera and that''s because there isn''t one. The 5MP snapper on the back is all you get.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motoe-handson-14-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto E review"></figure></p><p>The screen is reasonably decent considering the Moto E is under &pound;100. It has a resolution of 540 x 960, giving it a pixel density of 256 pixels per inch.</p><p>That''s not super sharp and you will notice pixels if you go looking for them, but it''s comfortable to use and actually comes out as the sharpest display in its category.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motoe-handson-15-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto E review"></figure></p><p>The screen isn''t super bright, even when at its maximum setting, and the colours could stand to be more vibrant too.</p><p>It does feel churlish to level such complaints at a bargain handset however; for the most part it''s nice to use and the lack of brightness only really becomes a problem in bright sunlight.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motoe-handson-13-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto E review"></figure></p><p>Viewing angles could be better. When viewed straight on it''s obviously fine, but when sat to the side of me on my desk the screen looked dark and washed out. Again though, this is a &pound;90 phone we''re talking about and considering the price tag I was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>It''s also coated in Gorilla Glass 3 to help it resist scratches and it has an anti-smudge coating, though still seemed to pick up a lot of fingerprints, far more so than my (admittedly much more expensive) .</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/motoe-handson-04-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Moto E review"></figure></p><p>The bezels to the left and right of the screen are nice and small, but the top and especially the bottom bezel are rather larger. </p><p>Presumably it''s space that''s being used internally but from the outside it looks wasted and betrays the low cost of the Moto E.</p><p>Still, that aside the Moto E is a decent looking device and with its solid build, scratch resistant screen, replaceable covers. It also has the added bonus of being water resistant, so overall it should prove pretty durable.</p><p>Which combined with its low price makes it a phone that you can safely use in places where you might not want to use a bank-breaking handset.

(219, 'OnePlus One review', '&quot;The OnePlus One offers Samsung Galaxy S5 performance for less than half the price. If that doesn''t make it attractive it also has a customisable OS and a 1080p display. There are a few downsides, but overall the OnePlus One is amazing value for money.&quot;', ' <p><em>Our OnePlus One has just received a software update which should address some of the issues experienced in this review. We''re currently going through the new software and will update this review with our findings soon.</em></p><p>The Google , the Google , the Motorola , and now the OnePlus One; this 5.5-inch bolt from out of the blue (well, China) joins an exclusive list of smartphones that offer an awful lot of smartphone for not a lot of money.</p><p>But having used the OnePlus One as my primary phone for several days now, I''m wondering whether it needs to be placed in a category all of its own.</p><p>Here is a device that rivals the  and the  for raw specs, but at a cost of just &pound;229, $299 (around AU$320). That''s less than half the price of those aforementioned big hitters.</p><p>As such, much of my early time with the phone was spent warily turning it around in my hands, like some kind of mysterious artefact of unknown origin, not quite ready to believe what was being promised of it. There has to be some compromise here, right?</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="v6x7m6eSR77vG"></div><p>Well, yes there is. In fact, there are several. But it''s staggering how small they seem when weighed against that double-take-inducing price tag.</p><p>Usually when a cheap smartphone boasts specifications that bloody the noses of the big boys, it''s the design that suffers. It''s far harder to make a solid, stylish, and hard-wearing mobile device than it is to throw in the latest off-the-shelf chip from Qualcomm.</p><p>However the OnePlus One is a pleasure to hold and to use. Okay, so it lacks the HTC One M8''s gorgeous metallic sheen, and you won''t turn any heads when you take it out of your pocket like you would with a golden . But show me the phone that does.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/front20blue-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="OnePlus One"></figure></p><p>The OnePlus One nevertheless feels great in the hand. It''s primarily made up of a quality matte plastic shell that extends around the back and sides of the device. This isn''t a unibody construction, and this rear panel can be removed for customisation purposes, but it''s firmly fixed in place with minimal creaking or flexing.</p><p>There''s a metal-effect plastic rim that separates this rear cover from the glass front, which cheapens the effect ever-so-slightly, but it''s thin and unadorned. It does mean that the aforementioned glass frontage appears to stand out rather than melding into the body of the phone, but it''s not an unpleasant effect.</p><p>All in all, it looks and feels like something of a cross between the Google Nexus 5 and the .</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/back-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="OnePlus One"></figure></p><p>The OnePlus One is not a particularly slim or light device, but then nor is it an absolute brick. At 152.9 x 75.9 x 8.9mm, its dimensions make it only slightly larger than the , which has a smaller 5.2-inch screen. What''s more, the OnePlus One is three grams lighter at 160g.</p><p>Of course, this is still a monster of a phone when you compare it to older or smaller devices. I always thought of my trusty old  as a bit of a beast, but the 4.7-inch phone feels positively dainty next to the OnePlus One. Meanwhile my iPhone 5S looked like a (rich) child''s toy when held next to it.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/with20iphone-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="OnePlus One"></figure></p><p>I''ve mentioned it a few times now, but the OnePlus One''s 5.5-inch display really is quite the specimen. At 5.5-inches it''s bigger than both the One M8''s and Galaxy S5''s, though it has the same 1920 x 1080 Full HD resolution. Admittedly that makes it a little less pixel-dense, but with 401ppi I defy anyone to call it anything but sharp.</p><p>If you''re thinking that OnePlus may have cut corners with the quality of this display, then think again. It''s an IPS display, which means it''s sharp and accurate even when viewed from an angle, and it''s made by JDI, the company responsible for the One M8''s excellent screen.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/badlands-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Badlands"><figcaption>Badlands</figcaption></figure></p><p>The default brightness seems a little weak, but crank it up and you''ll get a picture that truly pops, with impressively deep blacks.</p><p>Perhaps the best illustration of this is to boot up the gorgeous Badlands game with its inky-black silhouettes layered over detailed amber backgrounds.</p><p>Around the back of the OnePlus One is the vaguely oblong black camera element that houses the lens and dual-LED flash. This has been allowed to jut out slightly, its flat surface peeking above the curved shell. I quite liked the effect, especially in concert with the funky OnePlus One logo situated below.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/camera20wood-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="OnePlus One"></figure></p><p>OnePlus has housed a tiny pair of stereo speakers on the bottom edge of the device - as held in portrait view - with two telltale rows of machined holes either side of the microUSB port.</p><p>Button placement is strong, with the power key situated two thirds of the way up on the right hand side and the elongated volume rocker opposite on the left hand side.</p><p>This is ideal for a device as large as the OnePlus One, as they always fall under a thumb or finger, whereas a top-mounted button would have required some finger contortion to reach single-handed.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/bottom20blue-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="OnePlus One"></figure></p><p>OnePlus has also included permanent capacitive hardware keys underneath the screen, which proves to be a mixed blessing. There''s a menu key, a home key, and a back-up key in that order. I found it very hard to see these keys, particularly in daylight, as they don''t light up very much at all.</p><p>They''re also mapped a little oddly by default, with multitasking set to an awkward double-tap of the home button.</p><p>On the plus side, you don''t have to use these keys at all, and you can also remap the keys to your liking. We''ll discuss the OnePlus One''s impressive customisation potential in greater detail over the next few sections.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/side20white-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="OnePlus One"></figure></p><p>Just about the only glaring weakness of the OnePlus One''s external design comes in the form of its SIM tray. It looks to be made of a cheaper, rougher form of plastic, and I found the access hole to be an absolute pig to use with my iPhone tool (which I had to use as the OnePlus didn''t come in its packaging).</p><p>Indeed, it seems as if this SIM accessibility was a problem for whoever used the phone before me, as the hole had a tatty and worn look to it, like it had been hand-drilled with a Black and Decker and a cheap drill bit.</p><p>This is the only external sign that we''re dealing with a new manufacturer''s first attempt at a high-quality smartphone.</p> ', 1, '../uploads/hanews/thumb/oneplusone-handson-10-160-80.jpg', ''),

To be clear the One Mini 2 is a shrunken version of the excellent  - although the design of the handset gives that away almost instantly.</p><p>Glance quickly at the One Mini 2 and you''d be forgiven for thinking it''s the full blown One M8. It''s a lot closer in design to its bigger brother than the original One Mini was to the .</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="59Xx8sDk4qYJ1"></div><p>The plastic band which ran round the circumference of the One Mini persists on the One Mini 2, but HTC has done a much better job of hiding it. You''re unlikely to notice it unless you look at the top or base of the handset.</p><p>At these two points the plastic rim widens to cover the whole depth of the One Mini 2, but down each side it''s pushed into a thin strip by the metal rear cover which hugs either edge.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/onemini2-handson-01-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One Mini 2 review"></figure></p><p>That brushed metal finish on the rear of the device feels supremely premium and the curved back means the One Mini 2 nestles nicely into the palm while the condensed size makes it a lot easier to hold on to.</p><p>Interestingly the One Mini 2 is actually thicker than both the One M8 (9.4mm) and the One Mini (9.3mm) coming in at a chunky 10.6mm - although the rounded corners and arched back do well to hide the fact.</p><p>Owners of the original HTC One will be puzzled to find that the One Mini 2 is actually the same height (137.4mm) thanks to the rounded finish employed in the handset''s design, although it is narrower at 65mm. </p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/onemini2-handson-05-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One Mini 2 review"></figure></p><p>I found that the reduced width (although it is an increase over the One Mini) made it easier to reach all areas of the 4.5-inch display during one handed operation.</p><p>The build quality is close to top notch and it really does feel like a smaller One M8, although I did find the nanoSIM tray on the left of the device didn''t sit completely flush with the case.</p><p>It''s very slightly raised at one end, and every now and then I''d run a finger over it and it would detract from the overall experience. Not a big issue, and something which may be addressed in future production batches.</p><p><figure><img src="uploads/hanews/onemini2-handson-11-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One Mini 2 review"></figure></p><p>Over on the right side of the HTC One Mini 2 there''s a volume rocker switch sitting just below another tray.

Kết quả này không như mong đợi của các đơn vị cung cấp nội dung nhạc số, các bên kinh doanh và thậm chí là giới sản xuất âm nhạc. Tính khả quan của việc thu phí nhạc số lại một lần nữa được đưa ra bàn luận bởi ngay từ ban đầu, đại đa số người nghe nhạc đều không ủng hộ việc thu phí.', '<p><b>Doanh thu tăng đều nhưng hiệu quả không tăng?</b></p>\n<p><b><br />\n</b></p>\n<p>Theo  đại diện của đơn vị cung cấp nội dung nhạc số MV Crop, từ 15 triệu đồng  ban đầu, tổng số tiền thu được từ các ca khúc, album cho tới thời điểm  sau 5 tháng đã tăng lên con số vài trăm triệu. Trong đó, số tiền thu  được tháng sau cao gấp rưỡi so với tháng trước.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Với các  mô hình ở nước ngoài, nếu 10% dân số chi trả cho việc mua nhạc đã là  thành công rồi, tại Việt Nam, các đơn vị kinh doanh nhạc số chỉ hy vọng  vào 5% người có ý thức. Thế nên, tín hiệu đáng mừng ở doanh thu tăng  cũng là điều mà các bên liên quan tự an ủi lẫn nhau để bước tiếp trên lộ  trình kinh doanh nhạc số đã vạch ra. Dù số tiền còn khiêm tốn nhưng đã  đạt được mục tiêu ban đầu là kéo các đơn vị tham gia vào cuộc chơi thu  phí tải nhạc.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div><img width="500" height="280" src="http://soha.flipboard.vcmedia.vn/flipboard/100/4574b3nhacso1.jpg" alt="Sau 5 tháng thu phí tải nhạc: Lại “đầu voi, đuôi chuột" title="Sau 5 tháng thu phí tải nhạc: Lại “đầu voi, đuôi chuột" />\n<div class="caption"><i>Trong tổng số khoảng 150 website kinh doanh nhạc số đang hoạt động thì chỉ có 18 trang ký kết tham gia thu phí nhạc số</i></div>\n<div class="caption"><i><br />\n</i></div>\n</div>\n<p>Tuy  nhiên, sự thành công ở mặt “tổ chức” không chứng minh được, việc kinh  doanh nhạc số có tính khả thi cao và mang lại lợi nhuận. Số tiền vài  trăm triệu có vẻ to tát nhưng chỉ là muối bỏ biển so với số lượng 45.000  ca khúc được bán trên 18 website kinh doanh nhạc số lớn nhất Việt Nam.  Hơn thế nữa, vài trăm triệu có khi còn chẳng đủ cho các nhạc sĩ, ca sĩ,  nhà sản xuất trang trải chi phí để cho ra đời một sản phẩm âm nhạc có  chất lượng.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Ngoài ra, nếu tính trung bình 1.000  đồng/bài hát thì trong 5 tháng chỉ có khoảng vài trăm nghìn lượt tải về.  Sự bỏ tiền “nhỏ giọt” của một ít người nghe có ý thức trong việc tôn  trọng công sức của các nhà sản xuất, nhạc sĩ, ca sĩ cũng không thể làm  thay đổi thói quen của đại đa số người đã quen với việc nghe và tải nhạc  miễn phí.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Sự giúp đỡ của giới nhạc sĩ khi phát động  phong trào “Nghe có ý thức” và tuyên truyền mạnh trên các mạng xã hội,  nỗ lực của các đơn vị kinh doanh trong việc khiến cho người dân hiểu ra  sử dụng nhạc miễn phí là trái pháp luật dường như không hề có hiệu quả.</p>\n<p><b><br />\n</b></p>\n<p><b>Siết chặt thu phí bằng hình thức chỉ cho nghe thử</b></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Ông  Phùng Tiến Công, Phó Tổng Giám đốc Công ty cung cấp nội dung nhạc số MV  Crop cho biết, dự kiến đến quý 2/2013, các website nghe nhạc sẽ chỉ cho  phép người dùng được nghe thử (preview) các ca khúc mới thay vì được  nghe trực tuyến toàn bộ ca khúc như hiện nay. Người dùng phải thanh toán  theo từng bài hoặc thuê bao tháng mới được nghe trọn vẹn ca khúc.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Tại  các nước phát triển mạnh về kinh doanh nhạc số như thị trường Âu-Mỹ hay  đơn cử ở châu Á là Hàn Quốc, việc cho nghe thử miễn một phần của ca  khúc là biện pháp thực tế để thu được tiền từ sản phẩm âm nhạc bán ra.  Người nghe không có lựa chọn nào khác là buộc phải mua từ các website  kinh doanh nhạc số để thỏa mãn niềm yêu thích nghe nhạc của mình, nghe  trọn cả bài hát.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Tuy nhiên, điểm mạnh tại các nước này  là họ có thể xây dựng được một hệ thống thanh toán bài bản và thuận tiện  cho người nghe. Tại Việt Nam ở thời điểm này, các hệ thống thanh toán  còn quá phức tạp bởi mỗi một đơn vị cung cấp nội dung nhạc số lại có một  cách thức thanh toán khác nhau (thẻ cào điện thoại, thẻ ATM, tài khoản  điện thoại, tiền ảo…). Không có hướng dẫn cụ thể cho từng cách thức  thanh toán khiến người nghe nảy sinh tâm lý ngại phiền toái.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div><img width="500" height="305" src="http://soha.flipboard.vcmedia.vn/flipboard/100/9fb39dnhacso2.jpg" alt="Sau 5 tháng thu phí tải nhạc: Lại “đầu voi, đuôi chuột" title="Sau 5 tháng thu phí tải nhạc: Lại “đầu voi, đuôi chuột" />\n<div class="caption"><i>Zing là 1 trong số ít trang có phân loại các ca khúc thu phí vào riêng một mục</i></div>\n<div class="caption"><i><br />\n</i></div>\n</div>\n<p>Ngoài  ra, thời điểm sau 5 tháng thu phí nhạc số, các bài hát Việt Nam vẫn  được phép tải công khai và miễn phí trên các trang đã đăng ký bán nhạc  số như zing, nhaccuatui… Cùng một ca khúc, nội dung giống nhau nhưng lại  có nhiều phiên bản miễn phí khiến người nghe vừa hoang mang lại vừa có  cớ để quay lưng lại với việc thu phí tải nhạc.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Về vấn  đề này, bên phía MV Corp cho biết, sẽ giải quyết dứt điểm trong năm 2013  và đặt mục tiêu đến 2015, thị trường nhạc số thực sự dịch chuyển và thu  phí nhạc trở thành điều đương nhiên đối với người dân.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Cũng  nằm trong lộ trình đã được xây dựng, trong thời gian tới, các website  cũng sẽ thử nghiệm việc bán nhạc qua điện thoại di động. Hiện nay, số  lượng người sử dụng điện thoại thông minh (smart phone) là khá phổ biến.  Thanh toán qua di động giải quyết được những khó khăn về kênh thanh  toán qua dịch vụ tin nhắn ngắn (SMS) với tỷ lệ ăn chia là 50-50 (nhà  mạng thu về 50% phí, 50% còn lại dành cho các website phân phối, ca sĩ,  nhạc sĩ…) và tạo sự tiện lợi cho người dùng.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Cũng trong  năm 2013, các website phải tự thân kinh doanh, đàm phán với các nhạc  sĩ, ca sĩ, nhà sản xuất để mua bản quyền những ca khúc mới nhằm tạo sự  cạnh tranh và thu hút giới trẻ. Phần lớn người nghe nhạc trên mạng là  người trẻ nhưng thời gian qua, các đơn vị kinh doanh chỉ cố kiếm lợi từ  những ca khúc “xưa” đã có đầy đủ tác quyền. Việc này cũng sẽ nâng cao  hơn nữa quyền tự chủ của các nhạc sĩ trong việc đưa “đứa con tinh thần”  ra với công chúng.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Một loạt các động thái cứng rắn của  các nhà kinh doanh và cung cấp nhạc số trong thời gian tới cũng nhằm đưa  ra thông điệp về một thị trường cạnh tranh lành mạnh và buộc người nghe  phải có ý thức trong việc sử dụng công sức, thành quả lao động của  người khác. Thông qua các trang kinh doanh này cũng có thể điều chỉnh  thị hiếu âm nhạc của giới trẻ và tạo sự tôn trọng hơn với âm nhạc chính  thống.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Thực tế cho thấy, ngành công nghiệp ghi âm Việt  Nam đang bị thiệt hại nghiêm trọng do tình trạng tải nhạc miễn phí trên  Internet và di động. Đĩa, album phát hành không có người mua, các nhạc  sĩ, ca sĩ cũng ngại đầu tư làm album vì sợ thua lỗ. Dù vẫn còn quá nhiều  bất cập và rắc rối đến từ phía các đơn vị kinh doanh nhạc số nhưng nếu  kết hợp chặt chẽ, làm mạnh tay và triệt để đối với sản phẩm âm nhạc miễn  phí thì có thể hy vọng vào một tương lai khởi sắc của ngành âm nhạc  Việt Nam trong thời gian tới.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<br />', '{"tags":["T\\u1ea3i nh\\u1ea1c","Mi\\u1ec5n ph\\u00ed"],"tags_rewrite":["tai-nhac","mien-phi"]}', '4574b3nhacso1.jpg', '2013-03-24 16:28:32', 184),

Chỉ có  hai dịch vụ duy nhất thực sự có sự liên kết với nhau là Google Talk  trong Gmail và G+ nhưng bất kỳ ai sử dụng hai hệ thống này sẽ nhận ra  mọi thứ tệ như thế nào.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Không dễ để xử lý tình trạng  này nhưng một giải pháp nền tảng chung sẽ cho phép Google vượt qua những  dịch vụ đối thủ như iMessage của Apple và BlackBerry Messenger. Theo  các nguồn tin riêng của trang Geek.com, dịch vụ hợp nhất này có tên gọi  là Babble và đang được xây dựng để giải quyết những vấn đề trên.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Babble  tiếp tục đi theo xu hướng hợp nhất mọi thứ của Google. Bạn có thể chia  sẻ ảnh trong cửa sổ chat như bạn làm trong G+ Messenger, bắt đầu cuộc  trò chuyện Hangout với bất kỳ ai trong danh sách bạn bè và cuộc trò  chuyện sẽ được thực hiện trong tất cả các dịch vụ khác. Ngoài ra, các  dịch vụ riêng lẻ sẽ được thống nhất trong một nền tảng và bạn sẽ có thể  dùng cửa sổ chát tương tự trong tất cả các sản phẩm của Google với những  tính năng tương tự.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div><img width="568" height="432" src="http://soha.flipboard.vcmedia.vn/flipboard/100/71ab361192.jpg" alt="Google sẽ thống nhất các nền tảng chat thành Babble 2" title="Google sẽ thống nhất các nền tảng chat thành Babble 2" />\n<div class="caption">&#160;&#160;</div>\n</div>\n<p>Hiện  tại, chưa có một thời điểm chính thức nào được công bố Babble sẽ ra mắt  nhưng các nguồn tin tiết lộ với Geek.com cho rằng Babble sẽ được giới  thiệu tại sự kiện Google I/O vào tháng 5 tới.

Nhưng họ không biết rằng điều đó đôi khi không thực sự cần thiết, mà còn khiến tốn tiền và tốn thời gian.', '<div>Đó là lập luận trong một bài báo nghiên cứu mới thống kê hiệu quả  của các công cụ tìm kiếm tiếp thị cho eBay. eBay cho rằng hiệu quả của  công cụ tìm kiếm tiếp thị (trả tiền để mua từ khóa tìm kiếm trên Google)  đôi khi không hiệu quả như chúng ta vẫn tưởng. Các nhà nghiên cứu giải  thích rằng quảng cáo tìm kiếm chỉ hoạt động nếu người tiêu dùng chưa xác  định được công ty phù hợp cho sản phẩm họ đang muốn tìm kiếm.</div>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<div>Các  nhà nghiên cứu cho biết những khách hàng có sự hiểu biết về các công cụ  tìm kiếm trên internet sẽ hiểu được sự sắp xếp các sản phẩm trên, và do  đó không bị ảnh hưởng nhiều bởi quảng cáo, có hay chăng chúng cũng chỉ  gây chú ý hơn mà thôi. Nói cách khác, 14,8 tỷ USD có thể tạo ra lưu  lượng truy cập đến một trang web, nhưng phần lớn truy nhập gia tăng một  cách cưỡng bức. Các tác giả nhấn mạnh rằng nghiên cứu chỉ đúng với các  &#160;thương hiệu nổi tiếng; và tất nhiên là các công ty nhỏ và có số người  nhận biết thương hiệu thấp được hưởng lợi từ xuất hiện cao hơn trong một  trang tìm kiếm.</div>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<div>Một phát ngôn viên của Google  nói rằng nghiên cứu trên "hơi khác biệt so với bình thường", khi mà các  chiến dịch quảng cáo đã đóng góp 89% lượng click vào quảng cáo tìm kiếm  đến các trang web của nhà quảng cáo, nhưng chỉ một nữa trong số đó quay  trở lại trang web đó ngay cả khi các web này được &#160;trả tiền để cho lên  top đầu danh sách tìm kiếm.</div>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<div>Nhưng với nhiều  người, kết quả của phòng nghiên cứu eBay đã giải đáp một thắc mắc có từ  lâu. Đó là người dùng có chú ý tới phần quảng cáo khi xem kết quả tìm  kiếm hay không.</div>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<div>Và thực ra có bao nhiêu người  sẽ tìm kiếm Kindle trên Google thay vì đến thẳng trang của Amazon, hay  sẽ có bao nhiêu người sẽ dừng lại và thực hiện thao tác tìm kiếm khi  muốn mua bàn phím Steampunk Victorian "Diviner"</div>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<div><img width="500" title="" alt="" src="http://genk2.vcmedia.vn/N0WoyYblO3QdmZFKPMtKnadHAHTevz/Image/Roti-beo-1432013/SEO_-Huyen-Roti-e1904.jpg" /></div>\n<div cụ="" tìm="" kiếm="" tiếp="" i="">&#160;</div>\n<div><i><br />\n</i></div>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<div>Điều  đáng ngạc nhiên là các nhà bán lẻ trực tuyến lớn đã không nhận ra điều  này. Ví dụ, 10 hãng chi tiêu lớn nhất về quảng cáo trên internet đã chi  2,7 tỷ USD trong năm 2011.</div>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<div>Nhưng tại sao? Câu  trả lời đơn giản là các nhà bán lẻ đang đếm số lượng những cú click  chuột cho một trang web nhất định, cũng giống như họ sẽ tính toán lợi  nhuận ứng với mỗi đồng vốn đầu tư ban đầu. Nhưng trong việc này, Ray  Fisman chỉ ra trên blog của Harvard Business Review, bộ phận tiếp thị  của những người khổng lồ bán lẻ trực tuyến đang "khó hiểu nguyên nhân và  sự tương quan" trong việc đo lường lợi nhuận trên đầu tư quảng cáo của  họ.</div>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<div>Sự nhầm lẫn này được duy trì  bởi nỗ lực khuyến khích người mua quảng cáo của Google khi chia doanh  số bán hàng thông qua các nhấp chuột cho chi tiêu quảng cáo, theo các  nhà nghiên cứu eBay. "Không phải hầu hết các công ty tư vấn cung cấp  công cụ phân tích tiếp thị thông qua việc sử dụng mô hình hồi quy dữ  liệu, khuyến nghị từ công cụ phân tích của Google không thực sự phù hợp  với thực tế," báo cáo của eBay. Công cụ này đã đóng góp phần đáng kể vào  doanh thu quảng cáo hàng tỷ USD của Google mỗi năm.</div>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<div>Phát  ngôn viên của Google cho biết: Kết quả &#160;giữa các nhà quảng cáo khác  nhau rất nhiều và và bị ảnh hưởng bởi nhiều yếu tố, chúng tôi khuyến  khích các nhà quảng cáo thử nghiệm với các chiến dịch của riêng họ.&#160;</div>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<div>Ông  này bổ sung rằng Google cung cấp các công cụ như AdWords Campaign  Experiments (Thử nghiệm chiến dịch quảng cáo từ khóa), Content  Experiments (Thử nghiệm nội dung) và đề nghị một phương pháp thống kê  cho các nhà quảng cáo để tiến hành các thí nghiệm riêng của họ tùy thuộc  và điều kiện địa lý và đặc điểm vă hóa mỗi quốc gia.</div>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<div>Nhưng  nếu phân tích của các nhà nghiên cứu thuộc eBay Research Lab chỉ ra là  đúng, thì hẳn là công cụ tìm kiếm lớn nhất thế giới có thể cần một công  thức mới và có thể là một mô hình mới.</div>\n<br />', '{"tags":["Yahoo","Google","Chat"],"tags_rewrite":["yahoo","google","chat"]}', 'Google-ads-e1904.png', '2013-03-24 20:02:20', 184),

Công ty VDC đã kiểm tra một số trang web như Cổng thông tin Chính phủ điện tử, website Bộ Thông tin và Truyền thông, báo điện tử Đảng cộng sản Việt Nam hiện đang đặt server tại VDC thì tình trạng kết nối từ thuê bao Internet của tất cả các nhà mạng, kể cả Viettel vẫn bình thường.</p>\n<p  0px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: none; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">&#160;</p>\n<p  0px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: none; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">Sau báo Dân trí, đến lượt báo Nhân dân điện tử cũng đã có phản ánh về vấn đề tương tự. Đặc biệt, trong lần này, phía Viettel đã lý giải, nguyên nhân của tình trang trên là là do “đang trong quá trình chuyển đổi hệ thống và phát sinh lỗi".

Báo Nhân dân điện tử đã có bằng chứng là ảnh chụp từ màn hình thiết bị cầm tay của một độc giả khi đọc báo Nhân Dân điện tử bằng<b  0px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: none;">&#160;3G</b>&#160;của Viettel.

Vấn đề đặt ra qua sự việc này đó là, đã không đưa ra những cảnh báo, chỉ dẫn, chia sẻ giúp người dùng nắm bắt được nguyên nhân từ đâu, hướng khắc phục thế nào... mà lời giải thích từ phía tổng đài nhà mạng lại “đá quả bóng” sang doanh nghiệp mà các tờ báo mạng, website đặt hosting.</p>\n<p  0px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: none; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">&#160;</p>\n<p  0px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: none; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">Có thể nói, cách hành xử đó của nhà cung cấp đã khiến khách hàng, kể cả những người sử dụng dịch vụ <a href="http://northstar.vn/tags/3g">3G</a> của Viettel lẫn những thuê bao đang đặt server tại VDC đều không hài lòng, thậm chí còn bị tổn thương. Cùng với đó, qua sự việc trên, dấy lên mong muốn cần có sự tham gia quản lý chặt chất lượng dịch vụ từ phía cơ quan quản lý nhà nước. Đây cũng là cơ sở để đưa ra những kết luận chính xác, khách quan nhất về chất lượng dịch vụ của nhà mạng.</p>\n<p  0px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: none; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">&#160;</p>\n<p  0px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: none; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">Còn nhớ, vào giai đoạn 2004-2006, thời điểm dịch vụ ADSL phát triển nóng tới mức chất lượng không theo kịp sự phát triển đã khiến người dùng không khỏi kêu ca, phàn nàn. Và năm 2006, cơ quan quản lý nhà nước khi ấy là Bộ Bưu chính Viễn thông đã sớm đưa dịch vụ truy nhập Internet ADSL thuộc diện bắt buộc phải quản lý chất lượng theo tiêu chuẩn ngành TCN 68-227.</p>\n<p  0px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: none; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">&#160;</p>\n<p  0px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: none; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">Tiêu chuẩn chất lượng ngành là cơ sở để người sử dụng giám sát chất lượng dịch vụ; cơ quan quản lý Nhà nước và các doanh nghiệp cung cấp dịch vụ thực hiện quản lý chất lượng dịch vụ theo các quy định của Nhà nước và của Bộ chủ quản.</p>\n<p  0px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: none; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">&#160;</p>\n<p  0px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: none; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">Cho tới thời điểm này, dịch vụ công nghệ 3G cũng đã được các doanh nghiệp cung cấp sang năm thứ tư. Với xu hướng hiện nay, khi nhu cầu sử dụng dịch vụ data của người dùng di động ngày càng tăng cao, thiết nghĩ, việc quản chặt chất lượng dịch vụ 3G sẽ giúp cho các “thượng đế” sử dụng dịch vụ có phí mà không bị chuốc lấy bực mình.</p>\n</div>', '{"tags":["Internet","3g"],"tags_rewrite":["internet","3g"]}', 'c4e028vnm20132362177.jpg', '2013-03-29 00:42:32', 184),

Then you can jerk your hand to right or left to skip tracks back or forward, shake the handset to shuffle your playlist and raise your arm slowly up or down to change the volume. It works more reliably than in the past, but with hard button controls readily available for all these functions (except Shuffle), it still feels like a bit of a gimmick, no matter how technically clever it is.</p>\n<p><strong>SensMe</strong></p>\n<p>Also on board are Sony Ericsson''s SensMe feature, which allows you to select tracks according to its place on a mood diagram, and Track ID, which identifies tracks on the W705''s FM radio, or anywhere else for that matter.</p>\n<p>The supplied headphones aren''t bad at all, though you''ll need to push them well into your ear cavity to get the best out of them (they sound tinny and dynamically thin unless they''re in deep enough to block out virtually all ambient noise). You can add your own via the 3.5mm jack adaptor and there''s also the option to add a wireless pair via stereo Bluetooth connection (we tried it with the wireless HBH-IS800 for around £80, which were up and running in a few seconds). You''ll need the corded variety though to act as the aerial for the 20-preset FM radio.</p>\n<p>The camera is a perfectly decent 3.2 megapixel model. It might lack some of the high-flying fripperies of Sony Ericsson''s photo-centric C-series but it cuts a fine dash regardless. Pics are generally sharp in good light with fairly robust colour, plus there''s a 3x zoom, burst mode (four pics), panorama (which pastes together three pics from left to right), LED photo light, and photo fix, which optimises light and contrast to improve your pics. There''s also a VGA camera on the front for video calls.</p>\n<p>Something we hadn''t seen before is X-PICT story, which gives you options for the dissolves between themed slide shows – so you can show your pics in a way that seems harmonious, joyful, energetic, relaxing or nostalgic. Gimmicky, yes, but fun all the same.</p>\n<p>You can send your pics direct to your website (there are built-in clients for Blogger, MySpace and Picasa) and while there''s no GPS on board, you can geotag your pics using bog-standard cell-ID if you feel the need.</p>\n<p><strong>HSDPA connection</strong></p>\n<p>The browser includes BBC iPlayer and Youtube apps and though it has a fast HSDPA 3G connection, the W705''s Wi-Fi connection makes the most of streaming video. Browsing is a largely painless experience too, with the onboard accelerometer flipping the screen to landscape, the better for viewing web pages, and incremental zooming readily accessible.</p>\n<p>In keeping with Sony Ericsson''s habit of including slightly bizarre features on Walkman handsets, the W705 includes Walk mate, a step counter that you can set as your wallpaper so you can make sure you keep your daily exercise up.</p>\n<p>Battery life was pretty good too, giving us a good three days of moderate use, even with Wi-Fi switched on permanently.</p>\n<p>The W705 may not have anything in the way of traffic-stopping new apps or interface, but as a solid, midrange update on the Walkman range, it''s very fine indeed.</p>', '', 'w705frontangleclosedwithheadsetsluxurysilver-800-160-80.jpg', 'Headsets_Luxury_Silver-800-623-80.jpg', NULL, 'Sony Ericsson''s latest Walkman is pitched at', 'Sony Ericsson''s latest Walkman is pitched at the top of the midrange, and features juicy extras like HSDPA 3G connectivity, Wi-Fi and a 3.2 megapixel camera.

(2, 'Samsung B2700 Bound review', 'samsung-b2700-bound-review', 'Don Miller', 'Techradar', 'Geared up to weather rough and tough conditions, Samsung''s B2700 is a hard-case 3G handset for the outward bound', '&#160;', '<p class="MsoNormal">The latest ruggedised mobile from Samsung, the B2700 is designed for outdoors active lifestyles, with toughened plastic bodywork that''s water-and dust-resistant to the ICE IP54 standard.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">While that doesn''t mean protection from heavy-duty damage or total water immersion, it does offer more defence against the elements than the average handset - whether you prefer you''re outdoors activities up a mountain or on a beach.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Samsung has certainly beefed up the specification from its earlier, relatively basic, Solid M110 active lifestyle handset. The B2700''s features roster is mid-range 3G, with a few outdoorsy features – such as compass, altimeter, pedometer and flashlight – to go with familiar multimedia gadgetry such as music and video players, video calling, and online functionality. Shooting duties are taken care of by a run-of-the-mill 2-megapixel camera on the back panel.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Initially available on 3 in the UK for around £127 on pre-pay, or from free on contracts, it''s an affordable way to toughen up your mobile act.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The muscly build of the B2700''s casing is part protective sealing, part rugged chic. Measuring 115(h) x 52(w) x 18(d) mm, and weighing 115g, it''s hefty for a regular candybar phone but is pocketable and feels comfortable in-hand. The moulded rubber-feel casing is grooved for solid wet-weather holding and no-nonsense, solid button pressing. As well as side keys for camera and volume, there''s a dedicated button for activating the flashlight – a powerful lamp built into the top edge of the phone.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">A spoiler-alike loop is moulded into the top, too, which can be used with a supplied plastic snap-hook for fastening the phone to your clothing or other gear. Our review sample came in sober black with grey edging, though versions with red edging or blue with black trim are also made.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The number pad and D-pad navigation should be satisfactorily usable in the cold or wet, with the amply sized keys adequately defined for a one-piece panel. It''s finger-friendly enough for pacey texting – unless you''re an outdoors type who insists on gloves.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The D-pad is prominent enough for easy clickability, and various shortcuts are pre-defined and easily user swappable for a host more. On the 3 optimised version we tested, the regular standby softkey options are re-designated for Favourites (access to numerous online services and social network sites) and Planet 3 content and services.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Samsung hasn''t gone overboard with the display; it''s a modest 1.9-inch, 262k-colour 176x220 pixels resolution screen. This takes care of business for the standard-issue Samsung menu navigation system employed here, a fairly straightforward set-up with an initial grid-based main menu spreading into a familiar variety of sub menu lists.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Above the display is the phone''s secondary front-facing camera, principally for video calling. The main shooter is on the back panel, without any cover to protect it.</p>\n<p><strong>Handling</strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">While the B2700 is more robust and resilient to weather than most mobiles, it''s designed to be water-resistant rather than fully waterproof. Still, we were able to submerge the phone briefly in water several times with no problems (though we''d advise against this in normal use, just in case).</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Similarly, it passed the shower test, and just to test that tough-guy bodywork, we gave it a few short drops with no visible damage. It''s not built to be smash-proof, so we didn''t batter it as we would a hardcore industrial phone like the Sonim JCB phone.</p>\n<p><strong>Imaging</strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The camera is an ordinary 2-megapixel shooter that puts in an unexceptional performance. It''s fired up by a dedicated side camera button, but by default it shoots in portrait mode rather than rotating to a landscape viewfinder. Full screen shooting means you''ll miss what''s being shot at the edges – so you get more in your pics than expected. You can choose a full picture ''standard ratio view'' option, but that shows you the viewfinder image squashed into a letterbox view. It''s not particularly satisfactory.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">There''s no autofocus or flash, and the settings adjustments are the usual array of phone standard options - white balance, colour effects, multi-shot options and so on. The phone produces limited results, lacking in finer detail but adequate for basic casual camera phone snapping. In decent light conditions, colour rendition looks pretty good. In low light indoors, image quality deteriorates significantly, looking soft and grainy, and with no flash you can forget about shooting in the dark.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Don''t expect much from video capture either; the B2700 shoots at 176x144 pixels resolution, producing low quality footage at 15 frames per second.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Music player</strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The B2700 does up its game for music playback however. Its music player supports MP3, AAC, AAC+, and WMA file formats, and users can download tracks speedily over the air from suitable mobile network services, or copy over to the phone from a PC. Bluetooth transfer is also supported.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Only 26MB of user memory is onboard, however, so if you want to load up with tunes, you''ll need to use a MicroSD memory card. Samsung doesn''t supply one with this phone, but cards up to 8GB can be used, slotting in under the battery pack, inside the water-sealed back cover rather than in a side slot.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The player software is typical Samsung fare, with a familiar roster of categories in simple lists, and a straightforward user interface. A pair of regular Samsung earphones are supplied, which are reasonably good at producing clear sound with enough detail. This normal in-ear pair may not be ideal for more active users; we''d have liked something that could hook on our ears for those more adventurous moments.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">There''s no standard 3.5mm headphone socket for replacing Samsung''s with your own, just an ordinary multi-connector side socket. Still, out-of-the-box sound quality is OK, with some nice bass in there. An FM radio is another welcome feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Outward bound</strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">A handful of active lifestyle features are included for outdoors types – an accurate compass that can be re-calibrated by movement, a pedometer, which gives a rough but not spot-on measure of steps taken and calories burned; and an altimeter, which didn''t appear to work too well accuracy-wise.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Google Maps is supported on 3''s optimised version of the phone, as well as the standard issue Google search and mail apps. The onboard browser delivers a typical 3G web browsing experience for this class of handset – solid and reasonably fast at rendering and getting around pages, but not particularly slick. The low res screen doesn''t help either.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The phone does have an RSS reader app for viewing regular updates from blogs and websites. There''s also a decent supply of regular standard organiser features, including a calendar, memo and tasks functions, calculator, world clock, convertor, alarms, stopwatch and timer. Naturally, email is supported too, with a document viewer for files received as attachments or otherwise copied over to the phone. A selection of games and/or trial games are pre-loaded, depending on the version you get.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Outdoors active users will be pleased with the B2700''s battery life and voice call performance. The phone basics deliver reliable and good quality calling, while Samsung''s figures for optimum battery life are up to 480 hours of standby time or 640 minutes of talktime between charges. We got a good three days-plus with our average usage.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>The B2700 isn''t in the same category as the few industrial-strength bruisers of the mobile world that are armour-heavy but feature-light. It may not be the most high-spec of 3G handsets, but this active lifestyle phone will cope well for work, rest and hard play, with some decent mid-level features inside to keep you entertained. If you''re looking for something affordable that''ll survive the great outdoors intact, this could be well worth exploring.</p>', '', 'samsungb2700front-done-160-80.jpg', 'SamsungB2700front-done-623-80.jpg', NULL, 'The latest ruggedised mobile', 'The latest ruggedised mobile from Samsung, the B2700 is designed for outdoors active lifestyles, with toughened plastic bodywork that''s water-and dust-resistant to the ICE IP54', '28/07/2014', 1, 3),

The E63''s key selling point is its QWERTY keyboard, which is a slight improvement on its predecessor''s by dint of being a couple of millimetres wider, with slightly larger keys.</p>\n<p>The original wasn''t difficult to use, and this one is a breeze, with rounded keys of rubberised plastic offering good purchase to nimble thumbs and just the right degree of feedback.</p>\n<p>Helpfully, it even beats similar keyboards from the likes of BlackBerry by including one-touch access to essential characters like the full stop and @ symbol.</p>\n<p>Like the BlackBerry, it''s easy to set up push email accounts (all you''ll need in most cases is your email address and password) and it can work with most of the major email standards, including Microsoft Exchange, Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail and others, though not BlackBerry Connect.</p>\n<p><strong>Budget version</strong></p>\n<p>The E63 feels a little cheaper than the E71 with plastic replacing the metal skin of the older phone. The E63 is slightly thicker too, though it still manages to be a gram lighter.</p>\n<p>Around the sides are micro USB port and microSD card memory slot (none is supplied) plus a 3.5mm headphone jack on top. But there are no volume buttons (you can use the D-pad while making a call or listening to media instead), voice notes button or camera shutter button.</p>\n<p>The web browser is a practical one, which does what it needs to with a minimum of style, but it delivers the goods. Zooming, address bar and keyword search can all be accessed via shortcuts on the numeric keypad and there''s a useful option that breaks down web pages into sections for easy navigation.</p>\n<p>There''s 3G access to the web, albeit without the faster HSDPA connection of the E71 though there''s also Wi-Fi for access to broadband networks.</p>\n<p><strong>Disappointing camera</strong></p>\n<p>The camera is probably the E63''s biggest disappointment. The 3.2 megapixel version on the E71 wasn''t particularly impressive, but this 2 megapixel number feels distinctly underpowered. There''s a single LED flash and self-portrait mirror plus a 2x digital zoom, but pics in anything less than excellent lighting conditions are prone to grain and even then colours appear washed out.</p>\n<p>Video is worse, offering just 15fps and tending to be jerky and smeared with movement.

You can make use of it by connecting up to a GPS receiver via Bluetooth.</p>\n<p>An odder omission is the fact that it doesn''t come with a data cable – you''ll need to buy one separately if you''re planning to connect to your PC - which, considering the potential of this powerful smartphone, is very likely.</p>\n<p>The battery held up very well, giving us a good three days of moderate use including video watching and some web browsing with Wi-Fi turned on throughout.</p>\n<p>The E63 cuts a few corners on its predecessor''s offering, but aside from the relatively poor camera, and the lack of GPS, there''s nothing major missing.

The stolid workhorses of yesteryear have been replaced by cool-looking recent models from HTC, Sony Ericsson and Samsung. Unfortunately, HP doesn''t appear to have received the memo, and despite some impressive specs, including full QWERTY keyboard, touchscreen, fast HSDPA internet connectivity, Wi-Fi, A-GPS and 3.1 megapixel camera, the Data Messenger seems to come from an older, less user-friendly age.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">It''s certainly not designed to be pocket-friendly, tipping the scales at 160g and measuring 114x174x57mm. True, there''s a certain minimalist style to the shiny front with faux chrome surround, but it still feels like a glossy black brick.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The QWERTY keyboard slides out with a slightly grating rasp and while it has the basics covered with 41 keys on four lines, the keys themselves are on the small side and lie flush with each other, so feeling your way around with your thumbs isn''t as easy as it should be.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Touchscreen support</strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The touchscreen offers QVGA (320x240 pixels) resolution and 65,000 colours – perfectly adequate in other words. We had some issues with sensitivity however, and found that it could be reluctant to respond to our thumb presses, so that we were forced to resort to the stylus (sturdy, metal, telescopic) more often than should have been necessary.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Below the screen are call stop and start keys at either end of a chrome bar and beneath them two touch-sensitive soft keys for the Windows menu and ''OK''. In-between is an unusual optical D-pad which uses a camera to detect the movement of your thumb so it works a bit like the touch-sensitive variety and can be pushed inwards with a click to access menus. No practical advance on other D-pads, but it worked fine.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The 3.1 megapixel camera proved to be okay within its limits, producing pictures with a reasonable degree of detail, if slightly washed out colour on occasion. It''s not the quickest available though, and it took us a good four seconds to launch and a further three from pressing the shutter button to picture capture – not ideal for quick snaps then.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Good light is essential for the Data Messenger''s camera, though there''s an LED flash for emergencies. There''s a 5x digital zoom, and a panorama mode, which allows you to take five pictures in sequence to make up a wide-screen 180-degree view. There aren''t many options for editing your pics though, since it will only allow you to zoom or rotate them. Video quality drops a bit, as you might expect, delivering consistently blurry images where movement was involved.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Basic Windows OS</strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">While many recent handsets have augmented the Windows Mobile 6.1 OS with specially designed, more user-friendly interfaces, the Data Messenger opts for the basic system – powerful, versatile, but not particularly intuitive, and occasionally an outright pain to find your way around. Thankfully, the default web browser is Opera (though Internet Explorer is also present), and surfing proved to be fine using the fast HSDPA 3G connection which supports up to 7.2Mbps downloads, or broadband via Wi-Fi.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Opening the keyboard switches the on-screen resolution to landscape mode, ideal for most web pages, you can move around pages by brushing your thumb across the screen and zoom in or out by double-tapping the screen.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Windows Media Player is the default for viewing videos or listening to music. Videos look okay on the screen but the sound is distinctly underpowered through the supplied headphones. You can add your own of course but they''ll need to have a 2.5mm jack rather than the much more popular 3.5mm variety.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Memory-wise there''s 256MB on board, which won''t take you very far, but you can add up to 8GB by microSD, which is much more like it, though there''s none supplied.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Plenty of Apps</strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">There''s A-GPS on board too, along with Google Maps, plus a 30-day voice-guided sat-nav trial. Other apps include Microsoft Office Mobile, allowing you to create and read Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents, though strangely there''s no Adobe Acrobat Reader for viewing PDFs.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The battery was on the not very side of impressive, delivering barely two days of moderate use, though we did have Wi-Fi switched on constantly and didn''t make use of Windows'' energy-saving features.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps this handset needed another month in R&amp;D to catch up with the times.

It has some elegant touches, with a black brushed metal and reinforced glass front panel, a rubber-feel back and a slim profile, but this model is more upfront about its fashionable status than its understated predecessor.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">There is solid function as well as style-conscious form though. It supports high-speed HSDPA 3G data connectivity, including audio and video streaming and downloading and video calling. It has a 3-megapixel camera with autofocus, and is geared up for music, too, with dedicated player control buttons and a standard 3.5mm headphone socket on the side. A 1GB MicroSD card is boxed with the phone, along with other logoed-up accessories in a swanky Emporio Armani branded carrying case.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The handset has been released in the UK initially as a Vodafone network exclusive.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">First appearances can be deceptive. The simple, stylish black look of the phone looks quite understated out of the box. Switch it on though and it jolts to life with a ring of neon-style LED appearing around the edges of the phone. On one side, this illuminates a hard-to-miss Emporio Armani logo – not the only branding, as there''s an eagle EA eagle logo perched on the back and another label under the screen.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The neon piping around the phone appears in intense electric red, blue or green – you can select which from a standby screen shortcut – and radiates when the phone is active. This includes incoming and outgoing call alerts, messages, and other keyboard tapping activities. You can switch it off, but its retina-catching glow is a key part of the Night Effect concept.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The flat, one-piece keyboard has no separate buttons, lines or ridges to differentiate individual keys, so finger action needs to be accurate to avoid mistakes. The control panel configuration is conventional navigation D-pad though with surrounding softkeys and call and end buttonry.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">This Vodafone-configured UK phone we tested has replaced the standard model''s phonebook standby softkey with a Vodafone live! mobile portal one. This makes accessing the phonebook trickier than it should be – there''s no one-hit hotkey pre-configured, which is unusual and can be frustrating. You can, though, re-set one of the out-of-the-box home screen shortcut options if you prefer quick access to your contacts list.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The bodywork measures a tall and slim 114.9(h) x 47.4(w) x 12(d) mm, and weighs a reasonable 90.2g. The screen is a 2.2-inch QVGA AMOLED display, bright and sharp but with average dimensions for a mid-range handset.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Around the sides, Samsung has introduced a microUSB port instead of its standard proprietary connector, which takes care of charging, USB connection and earphones – offering the opportunity to slot in a second set of headphones at the same time as the boxed microUSB connected headset.</p>\n<p><strong>Features </strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">There''s a set of shortcut icons for five key features on the home screen, which can be scrolled through and selected using the D-pad. These can be changed to suit how you use the phone – so you can swap the light-colour changing option to something more practical, if you prefer.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The menu system is mostly regular Samsung. The main menu has, however, been set up out of the box to present a carousel rather than grid menu of options, though this can easily be swapped to a more conventional 4x3 icon layout. Naturally, a crop of Emporio Armani themes, wallpapers and tones come loaded up to maintain that overall fashion-savvy look.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Music and fashion go well together here. The side controls aren''t essential for operating the music player - the D-pad can do that too - but they can work it smoothly when tunes are playing in the background.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The music user interface is familiar Samsung, albeit with a touch of EA re-skinning for the playback screen. Songs are slotted into a standard set of MP3 player categories, and the track roster can be easily synced with Windows Media Player 11 on a PC. Samsung PC Studio software can also handle track copying, and there''s always a drag and drop option in mass storage mode. Alternatives to USB hook up include Bluetooth and copying on to a suitable MicroSD card – and that 3.6Mbps max HSDPA means fast downloading over the air from an online music source is another option.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal"><br />\nWith 120MB of internal memory, that 1GB in-box will come in handy for stacking up tunes. It''s well worth using; the player is capable of a cracking audio performance. The supplied in-ear earphones sound surprisingly good - better than the norm for a phone. And that 3.5mm socket allows you to plug in your own quality headphones to get the maximum out of the tidily delivered audio.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">A serviceable FM radio is part of the spec too, and Samsung has included song recognition software for discovering remotely the names and details of tunes you hear around you.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera </strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The main camera isn''t a range-topper but is a decent enough mid-level 3.2-megapixel shooter. It has a dedicated snapper button, and flips into landscape mode for camera action. It''s autofocus system works crisply and speedily, and is good too for close-up shooting. In addition, there''s a Smile shot option among the various settings, which enables the camera to automatically take photos only when it detects the subject is smiling.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Shots taken with the camera in decent lighting come out well; colours are bright natural and shots are reasonably detailed for this level of snapper. Without a flash, low-light shooting isn''t so good, while shots in the dark are just that.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">There is a scoop of fairly normal cameraphone adjustments you can make and shooting effects you can add. Post-shooting editing options are available too, plus you can upload images and videos to online sites via Shozu software on the phone.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Video quality is disappointing. The main camera shoots video at 176x144 pixels resolutions at 15 frames per second, which is basic for this class of phone, and footage is suitably forgettable.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Of course, the phone does support downloadable and side-loaded video clips, which play back more smoothly and in higher quality, albeit on a modest amount of screen space. File formats supported include H.263, H.264, MPEG4 and WMV.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal"><br />\nVideo clips as well as audio tracks can be downloaded or streamed over the air. Pre-loaded links on our Vodafone sample for the Vodafone live! mobile internet portal and other online services (including video downloads and mobile TV) offer some obvious options.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">The browser on this phone is a run-of-the-mill NetFront browser, which works reasonably quickly at flicking between pages, using HSDPA-speed 3G. It does a normal, middle-of-the-road mobile phone browsing job, without being a particularly enticing experience.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal"><br />\nStandard issue features also include a set of organiser options and typical phone tools. Email is supported, with a document viewer app that can be used for viewing attachments. Calendar, calculator, convertor, memo, tasks, world clock, stopwatch, alarms and timer functions are all present and correct, plus there''s a voice recorder and an RSS reader option.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Performance</strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Thankfully, the light show on this handset doesn''t appear to take too much of a toll on battery life. Samsung estimates that a full charge will deliver up to 420 minutes of talktime on a GSM network, or up to 260 minutes in 3G coverage. Alternatively, standby is reckoned at up to 345 hours on GSM networks or 275 hours on 3G – a reasonable mid-range performance. In our tests, we clocked up between 2-3 days of standby time with our normal phone usage.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">We had no issues with voice calls on this phone either, with it producing a steady voice performance and reliable network coverage.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Far from being a phone for fence-sitters, the Emporio Armani Samsung mobile has a distinctive identity that will divide opinion. Brand attraction will have as much a part to play in the buying decision as any functionality concerns. Its features rundown may be more mid-range high street than high-end couture, but for the phone fashionista that label-appeal will no doubt be the main draw.</p>', '', '48905gt-m7500adimagelarge-160-80.jpg', '48905_GT-M7500_ADImage_Large-623-80.jpg', NULL, 'Any phone that arrives with', 'Any phone that arrives with a fashion label prominently displayed is bound to be scrutinised for any potential style versus substance line-crossing.The', '28/07/2014', 1, 3),

It has many of the W910i''s features, including HSDPA connectivity, and the latest Walkman gadgetry.</p>\n<p>Its design has some neat chrome trimmings and rounded edges for a more ergonomic and classy look. Solid in the hand, the build quality is excellent and boasts a smooth slide action – albeit at the expense of greasy fingers on the screen. You''ll want to polish those off, because the screen itself is wonderfully crisp and vivid. With all these advantages, it seems a shame you have to practically snap the back cover off to access the battery, SIM and memory card.</p>\n<p>Despite the limited space the keypad layout makes the most of it, while an array of hotkeys beneath the screen means you don''t have to delve too deeply into the menu. Nonetheless, the menu is easy to operate and well laid out in typical Sony Ericsson style. Some great icons and a colourful, fun design make it a pleasure to whiz round.</p>\n<p><strong>Walkman player</strong></p>\n<p>The handset''s music playing capabilities lie at the heart of its arsenal and the addition of a few gimmicky features should inspire you to try them at least once. TrackID is arguably the most useful, allowing you to record a few seconds of a song to send to Gracenote''s database for recognition.</p>\n<p>Less useful is the new Shake control ''a la'' Apple''s iPod nano – good in theory, but less so in practice. The idea is that with Shake control activated you can just press the Walkman button and with a flick of the wrist change tracks; in reality it would be just as easy to use the dedicated transport controls marked on the navpad.</p>\n<p>Providing you use the bundled Media Manager PC software, SensMe is another novelty idea worth a trial run. Basically it allows you to create mood- and tempo-defined playlists, but users of Apple''s new Genius function may find it a little crude.</p>\n<p>The Walkman 3.0 player itself has Sony Ericsson''s rather attractive music player interface, with the usual detailed track categories and functionality. Sony Ericsson supplies the phone with a 2GB Memory Stick Micro memory card included, which is decent for a phone at this price level. There''s only 40MB of internal storage, so memory cards are essential if you want to listen to a good selection of tunes.</p>\n<p><strong>Headphones adaptor<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, though, Sony Ericsson is still reticent about including a 3.5mm input on the handset itself, sticking with the rather clunky adaptor on the two-part headset instead.</p>\n<p>The bundled set of earphones are still better than most you get with a mobile phone, and the music player is capable of a rich and dynamic audio performance that''s very pleasing on the ears.</p>\n<p>There is also support for A2DP stereo Bluetooth if you''d prefer to take the wireless approach to headphones,. The loudspeaker is just that – loud – but still retains the tinny overtones that often resonate from busses at school kicking-out time.</p>\n<p><strong>Practical features</strong></p>\n<p>As we said earlier, the W595 isn''t just about attracting the youth market – it''s backed up by some solid technology and Sony Ericsson''s manufacturing know-how.</p>\n<p>Another plus is that the handset has an ''always on'' internet connection offering HSDPA support for fast 3G data transfer, so it''s easy to access large files, download music or stream video. It comes in particularly handy when using the integrated YouTube app, enabling you to view content online, as well as upload your videos in a few clicks.</p>\n<p>An accelorometer is also built in so you can flick the screen between portrait and landscape layouts, depending on what you''re viewing. This is great when using the web browser and camera – the later of which ups the megapixel count to 3.2MP. It''s still not enough to challenge those Cyber-shot-touting stablemates, with images suffering on account of its lack of autofocus and flash.</p>\n<p>Like most self-respecting phone these days, the W595 comes equipped with easy access to upload content online, with that YouTube application and options to upload images to Blogger accounts. In addition, on the version of the handset available from 3, social networking apps include Facebook, MySpace and Bebo, while the 3 model also adds native Skype, eBay and Windows Live Messenger clients.</p>\n<p>Other valuable applications onboard include Google Maps, an excellent mapping application for network based approximate positioning, location finding, search and routing,</p>\n<p><strong>Solid performer</strong></p>\n<p>Ultimately the Sony Ericsson W595 won''t win any awards for pushing technological boundaries, but it will provide a solid, reliable handset with an element of fun.</p>\n<p>Call quality is excellent, both tonally and in terms of reception, and battery life is more than respectable giving on average around four days.</p>\n<p>Combine this with the inclusion of HSDPA, some genuinely useful apps and the daddy of all mobile music players, and the Sony Ericsson W595 would be a fitting addition to many stockings this Christmas.</p>', '', 'sew595-218-85-160-80.jpg', 'se-w715-2.jpg', NULL, 'Is it us, or has somebody upped the ante with', 'Is it us, or has somebody upped the ante with mid-tier mobiles?

(7, 'LG KF900 Prada review', 'lg-kf900-prada-review', 'Don Miller', 'Techradar', 'Much improved spec-wise, but the added bulk of this phone may but some of the more style-conscious off', '&#160;', '<p>The second collaboration between LG and fashion house Prada, the KF900 Prada Phone by LG delivers a distinctly refreshed and reworked take on the original touchscreen luxury-brand phone, whilst retaining much of the minimalist charm of the original.</p>\n<p>Sharp design is obviously a key part of the package, and the KF900 Prada II doesn''t veer too much from the upfront look of the first Prada phone.</p>\n<p>That sleek black body with tasteful chrome trim that originally arrived a few months ahead of the iPhone has been repeated almost exactly on the new device.</p>\n<p><strong>Slide-out keyboard<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>What''s definitely new, though, is the slide out full Qwerty keyboard that slips out from the side of the phone, all elegantly buttoned up with 39 keys well-spaced on the metallic slider. It adds some spread to the dimensions, and ups the weight of the handset, but it also adds to the functionality of the phone''s messaging, note taking and browsing capabilities.</p>\n<p>It''s not only its fashionable form that''s been enhanced though, function has been upgraded too. The Prada phone''s touchscreen user interface has been refined, adding much of the usability seen on models like LG''s Renoir and Cookie, plus pinch-to-zoom multi-touch control for browsing and image viewing.</p>\n<p>Features have also had a facelift; this model has HSDPA high-speed 3G connectivity (up to 7.2Mbps) plus Wi-Fi support, and a 5-megapixel camera with a Schneider-Kreuznach certified lens and slow-motion video playback.</p>\n<p>Its parade of multimedia functions include music and video players, support for high-speed streaming and downloading of content, plus video calling via a secondary front-facing camera.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-touch screen</strong></p>\n<p>The original minimalist Prada phone design reprised here is still very stylish, even if our post-iPhone familiarity with that much-imitated look has made it less immediately striking.</p>\n<p>The large 3-inch screen is a WQVGA (240x400 pixels) resolution, 262K-colour capacitive multi-touch display, which takes up much of the front panel. An accelerometer automatically switches screen orientation in certain features, so you get appropriate sideways or portrait views of images, browser pages, video clips and so on.</p>\n<p>At 104.5(h) x 54(w) x 16.75 mm the phone is noticeably thicker in the pocket than the original Prada, and the extra bulk of the keyboard helps chunk up the weight to a substantial 130g. It gives it a very different in-pocket feel from the skinny 12mm thin, 85g Prada 1.</p>\n<p>A thin chrome strip beneath the display features Call, End and Clear keys, but besides a Prada logo and a video call camera above the screen, that''s pretty much it for the front. Around the side are a lock button, a camera key, and volume/zoom controls. A further Multi-tasking button pulls up tabbed lists of live apps and favourite functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Practical layout</strong></p>\n<p>The slide out Qwerty keyboard is robust, and has a solid but smooth action. The rectangular keys are large and well spaced for comfortable tapping.</p>\n<p>Sliding out the keyboard from standby automatically switches the screen sideways, bringing up a carousel display of touch icons for apps where the keyboard comes into its own, such as text messaging, memo, browser, to-do lists and emails. It''s a practical set-up for heavy text typers.</p>\n<p><strong>Prada features</strong></p>\n<p>Touch action control is, naturally, star of the show though. The user interface employs similar but not identical operation to the Renoir and Cookie.</p>\n<p>The monochrome themes – black on white, white on black – pre-loaded on the phone are stark by contrast, and minimal chic can feel a bit dull after a while. Special Prada wallpapers – including model shots from its autumn/winter lookbook – add a splash of colour, and Prada ringtones and effects are included to extend the exclusive fashion house feel.</p>\n<p>The touch interface, however, is generally capably implemented, with LG continuing to keep things mostly straightforward and easily manageable with simple finger-swipe action on the spacious screen, and haptic feedback confirming presses.</p>\n<p>The home screen set-up has a novel three-way view you can swipe between with a sideways stroke of the finger, like turning a page. One is a clear uncluttered standby display, another offers a user-definable set of shortcut touch icons onscreen, while the third allows you to set up onscreen widgets by dragging and dropping apps from a selection in a pop-out widgets toolbar at the bottom of the display.</p>\n<p>Like the Cookie, the handy widgets are limited to seven mini apps that can be activated and used with a couple of taps - world clock, calendar, clock, memo, music player, radio and image gallery. But there''s a lot of scope for tailoring your shortcuts page.</p>\n<p><strong>Speedy navigation<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Along with the Multi-tasking button and keyboard screen shortcuts, the Prada II provides plenty of ways to get to your favourites without entering the main menu system. Not that it''s difficult to use, mind – navigation is very logical and intuitive.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the home screen are four virtual hotkeys for essentials that don''t change when you switch between home pages – phone numberpad, contacts, messaging, and main menu.</p>\n<p>Tapping the row of status info at the top of the display also pulls up more detailed information on network connection, memory, battery, etc., plus further quick-start options for the music player, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth – which can be very useful when looking for quick connections.</p>\n<p>Tapping into the main menu, it''s familiar form from LG''s recent touchscreen models. A column of four category icons appears on the right of the screen; a press of any of these changes the main screen grid of options to reflect that particular category – Communicate, Entertainment, Utilities or Settings.</p>\n<p>It''s a well-worked system that makes it quick and easy to locate the functions you''re after with just a few presses. Once you choose a category, you can navigate the sub menu options with a scroll or press of options in a quite easy to follow way.</p>\n<p>There''s sufficient room on the display to scroll around or select options without worrying about mis-pressing or finger-straying errors. It''s by no means as smooth and slick a user interface as the iPhone''s benchmark-setting touch control system, but it does its job effectively enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Picture gallery<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>One grumble we did have was with the frustrating text message touchscreen option - although this can be got around easily enough by using the Qwerty keyboard instead.</p>\n<p>Problem is, the onscreen alphanumeric keys are squeezed into the left portion of the display, with too close control options running down the right next to the 3, 6, 9 buttons – making it too susceptible to annoying finger-slip errors and mode changes mid-typing. Other than that, though, we found it quite a satisfactory touch interface.</p>\n<p>What''s more, LG has implemented a pinch-to-zoom iPhone-style multi-touch option for looking at images in the phone''s gallery, and for zooming in and out of webpages on the device''s full internet browser. Using thumb and forefinger to zoom in or out by bringing together or pulling apart on a pic or webpage, this works almost effortlessly and adds a pleasing touch element to the fairly straight control system.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera action</strong></p>\n<p>The camera itself is a decently performing 5-megapixel shooter. It doesn''t have the full firepower of the Renoir''s 8-megapixel top-of-the-range shooter, but it can produce finely detailed, high quality images with good colour reproduction.</p>\n<p>It automatically flips into side-ways camera-alike mode when the camera''s fired up. The touch user interface is easy to get to grips with, thanks to a combination of icons and pop up lists of options within the settings options.</p>\n<p>The autofocus system works smartly and efficiently, though the 2-step button can lag a fraction between pressing and snapping when taking quick shots so be careful of movement before the image is captured to avoid blur.</p>\n<p>There are a typical selection of settings to cope with different conditions, plus a macro mode for close ups that does the job well. An LED flash is included rather than a more effective xenon type, and so low-light images aren''t as impressive as shooting in normal daylight conditions. Illumination is limited to a few feet and shots in dark situations can look grainy and noisy, and colour rendition isn''t particularly good.</p>\n<p><strong>Picture editing<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Shots can be tweaked after shooting, with a wide selection of effects, drawing, text and colouring options that can be applied by a bit of judicious finger action.</p>\n<p>The Prada phone has a decent set of video capture features too. As well as shooting in 640x480 pixels (VGA) and 720x480 pixels resolution at 30 frames per second for reasonably good mobile phone quality, it can also record in slow-motion mode at a higher frame rate for slowed down playback. Further tools allow manipulation of clips and basic in-phone editing.</p>\n<p>It''s video playback for downloaded, streamed or sideloaded content is up to scratch too. It supports DivX video playback, with conversion software supplied for PCs, and the large display offers a good platform for playing back moving images.</p>\n<p><strong>Online and other activity</strong></p>\n<p>With Wi-Fi and HSDPA powering the browser on this handset, plus the multi-touch zoom control, you can enjoy a reasonable browsing experience. Pages generally load up promptly, and it''s easy to scroll around and navigate pages. Onscreen icons also provide an intuitive layer of navigation many mobiles ignore. It''s not iPhone-slick, though - more like a decent mid-tier phone effort.</p>\n<p>The music player has a typically low-key LG user interface based on selecting from lists of familiar track categories, and a no-hassle touch control panel when tracks are playing, with a draggable timeline on tunes. The music player can be used in the background in standby or using other functions, too, with one of the widgets enabling control of the functions.</p>\n<p>With 60MB of internal storage, music fans will need the 1GB MicroSD memory card that LG includes in the luxury Prada phone package. There''s also a better than average set of earphones provided, which sound very serviceable, offering a decent amount of bottom end and higher frequency detail.</p>\n<p><strong>Generous range of features<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Although there''s no standard 3.5mm headphone socket on the bodywork, the two-piece Prada-labelled earphones have a standard 3.5mm headphone adapter built in, so you can add you very own higher quality (or expensively-branded) headphones. Bluetooth headphones are also supported.</p>\n<p>An FM radio adds to the music-playing abilities of this handset, doing an effective job with a no-fuss user interface. Other entertainment is provided by a couple of staple LG motion-controlled games (rolling dice and wheel of fortune), plus a touch operated golf game. Further Java games can be downloaded.</p>\n<p>Although it will appeal to the style-first buyer, it still maintains a run-down of practical common-but-useful features and tools. Email attachments and copied over PDF, Word, text, Powerpoint and Excel files can be read by an integrated document viewer, while organiser software includes a calendar, calculator, memos and to do lists, world clock, convertor, calculator, alarm, stopwatch and voice recording functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Phone performance</strong></p>\n<p>Even with a luxury Prada phone, ordinary phone calling is still a key function. Easy access to and easy use of the numberpad and contacts make it a breeze to use for voice calling, and sound quality is first rate. Network connectivity is reliable, and the Wi-Fi set-up works easily.</p>\n<p>How much users will get from a full battery tank will depend on how much they use the high-powered features. LG reckons on an optimum rundown time of up to 3 hours of talktime or 400 hours of standby, which is an acceptable estimate for this sort of device. In our tests, on average we got over two days out of the phone in standby with our typical usage - a reasonable performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Sleek yet functional<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>While the face of the Prada phone has changed little from the sleekly stylish original, there have been distinct changes to form as well as function. The slide-out Qwerty keyboard is finely implemented, but inevitably it adds more bulk to the phone – something that fashion conscious buyers will appreciate less than high-rolling business types.</p>\n<p>The functionality and touchscreen user interface have been vastly improved over the original, making it a far higher specified, more accomplished device than other style-brand specials. Whether that added bulk is justified enough by those features is a question would-be buyers will have to decide themselves, and some may choose to look elsewhere for slimmer phones, or mobiles that have alternative attractions inside as well as out.</p>\n<p><strong>Network availability:</strong> Orange, others TBC</p>\n<p><strong>Looks:</strong> 4.5/5<br />\n<strong>Ease of use:</strong> 4/5<br />\n<strong>Features:</strong> 4/5<br />\n<strong>Call quality:</strong> 4.5/5<br />\n<strong>Value:</strong> 3/5</p>', '', 'lg20prada20kf900-160-80.jpg', 'LG_Prada_KF900-623-80.jpg', NULL, 'The second collaboration between LG and', 'The second collaboration between LG and fashion house Prada, the KF900 Prada Phone by LG delivers a distinctly refreshed and reworked take on the original touchscreen luxury-brand phone, whilst', '28/07/2014', 1, 3),

(9, 'LG KC780 review', 'lg-kc780-review', 'Don Miller', 'Techradar', 'Hot shot 8-megapixel cameraphone at a mid-range price but lacks higher-end features to match the snapper', '&#160;', '<p>Having been quick on the draw with its first UK 8-megapixel mobile sharp shooter, the Renoir KC910, LG has now doubled its 8-million pixel cameraphone line-up with the release of the KC780.</p>\n<p>While the Renoir is pitched as a high-end touchscreen device, with a roster of the latest must-have gadgetry, the LG KC780 is a more modestly equipped sliderphone, aimed at bringing 8-megapixel cameraphones to the mass market.</p>\n<p>It has a more affordable price tag than the Renoir and other 8-megapixel competitors. But it also has a more down-range set of features than its stablemate - and other current 8-megapixel hot-shots such as the Samsung Pixon and i8510, and the Sony Ericsson C905.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic connectivity<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Clearly, much of LG''s attention has been paid to the KC780''s camera abilities. There''s no 3G support on the KC780, let alone Wi-Fi connectivity, with this tri-band handset running data over lower speed GPRS/EDGE. It doesn''t do any fancy touchscreen control either, relying on a more conventional mobile user interface, and you won''t find GPS or smartphone functionality – all options available on other 8-megapixel competitors.</p>\n<p>The camera is where the main action is here. Its 8-megapixel sensor is supported by Schneider-Kreuznach certified optics, and there''s a dual-LED flash on the back for low-light shooting. Its autofocus-equipped camera gadgetry isn''t as extensive as the Renoir''s lavish touch-operated system, but it does have more than your average mobile snapper. Video capture too is a few notches above the norm.</p>\n<p>Although it doesn''t offer 3G functionality, the LG KC780 does have a fairly standard, if unexciting, set of mid-level feature to keep mobile users going. Music and video players, and an FM radio add to the entertainment quota, while a rack of organiser tools are to hand. A novel Bluetooth webcam feature is employed alongside the regular Bluetooth stereo headset and file transfer options.</p>\n<p><strong>Sleek sliderphone<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The KC780''s slider design is reasonably slim. At 105(h) x 51(w) x 13.7 (d) mm and 119g it''s not particularly petite, though. The design of its bodywork is workaday sliderphone, and cased in unspectacular black plastic, it''s not particularly hot in the style stakes.</p>\n<p>The controls are well-sized with a conventional layout, based around a navigation D-pad, flanked by softkeys under the display and traditional Call, End, and Clear keys. In standby the Clear key also operates the phone''s Dashboard function, which brings up calendar, image viewer and a clock features on screen, which you can scroll through and customise.</p>\n<p>The Clear key position is a bit tight against the D-pad, which means you do have to be careful with pressing the down arrow, but otherwise controls are pretty straightforward.</p>\n<p>It has a decent-sized display or a mid-range handset - a 2.4-inch screen offering QVGA resolution. It''s clear and bright enough for viewfinder purposes and video playback, though doesn''t match the big-display touchscreen phones for sheer screen space. A motion sensor accelerometer flips the display orientation according to how the phone''s being held.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple controls<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The numberpad on the slider is nicely configured too, with slight bumps under each number and chrome dividers between rows helping fingers to differentiate keys on the otherwise smooth surface.</p>\n<p>Sweeping around the phone, a MicroSD slot on the side provides room for memory cards up to 8GB (none is supplied in the box), while there''s a typical camera shooter button and volume/zoom controls. Unsurprisingly, there''s no 3.5mm standard headphone socket for using your own headphones, the KC780 working the usual LG multi-connector on the side of the phone for charging, USB connection and earphones.</p>\n<p>Apart from the Dashboard, it''s a fairly straightforward, standard-issue LG mid-tier user interface. The D-pad offers typical shortcut options, while the main menu is a grid-based set-up (though you can swap for lists if you prefer). Sub-menu options are mostly in list format, with numbered options for quick selection via the numberpad rather than scrolling.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera focus<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>With a limited set-of marquee features, the 8-megapixel camera''s performance is the focus of this handset.</p>\n<p>The good news is that it''s well capable of taking high quality images, with the 8-megapixel shooter producing sharply detailed shots that offer good tonal reproduction. Its auto system adapts responsively to changing lighting conditions, and the autofocus appeared reliably precise and efficient, with an impressive macro shooting close-up mode.</p>\n<p>Utilising a normal two-step autofocus set up, there''s a momentary 1 - 2 second lag as you press the shutter button for a quick shot, so watch out when snapping moving subjects.</p>\n<p><strong>Speedy snaps<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>From standby the camera takes around 3 seconds to start up after pressing the side camera key.</p>\n<p>Among the camera features, a face tracking option helps out the autofocus system, locking on to faces it detects as you''re composing shots, to get people in focus. A Smile shot option can be selected too for ensuring the camera only shoots when it detects a subject is smiling, even after you''ve pressed the shutter button.</p>\n<p>A good selection of camera gadgetry includes an image stabiliser option, a variety of settings adjustments (white balance, ISO, exposure, colourisation effects), and a Smart lighting setting for tricky lighting conditions - though this, like multi-shot and panorama modes, automatically switches shooting to a lower resolution setting.</p>\n<p><strong>Lacklustre flash<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Image results can be impressive for a mobile. In good light conditions, images come out particularly well and colours are vibrant, though in murkier conditions, colours do appear softer.</p>\n<p>Low light shooting, despite the LED flash, isn''t brilliant. A xenon flash, such as that used on the Sony Ericsson C905, would''ve improved illumination, as an LED flash isn''t as powerful or precise enough for snapping in darker conditions over more than a few feet away. Dim-light shots indoors tended to be gloomy and grainy.</p>\n<p>Post-shooting, there''s a standard-issue set of LG in-phone editing options – a good variety for an average phone, but nothing exceptional for a mid-level LG handset.</p>\n<p><strong>Decent video quality<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The KC780 puts in a better effort than most for video shooting, capturing footage at 30 frames per second in the highest quality 640x480 pixels (VGA) or 720x480 pixels resolutions.</p>\n<p>It produces smooth, reasonable quality video clips for a mobile phone. A slow-motion shooting mode provides another better-than-most playback option, though it does record in lower QVGA resolution.</p>\n<p>Playing back video on the 2.4-inch display is decent enough. You can copy over video from a PC or watch content on a MicroSD card, or download clips over the leisurely GPRS/EDGE data connection, with the KC780 supporting DivX video playback. A TV-out option is available in the features, though no cable is boxed with the phone.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimalist music player</strong></p>\n<p>The KC780 has 140MB of internal memory, so if you have ambitions to listen to tunes on the phone''s music player,it would be wise to splash a few quid on a MicroSD card.</p>\n<p>The music player software here is again standard LG stuff. It''s functional and unspectacular looking but does the job effectively enough. Tracks are organised in conventional lists of categories – all songs, artists, albums, playlists, and genres – and when the player''s rolling, the D-pad takes care of control business.</p>\n<p>Average quality earphones are supplied in-box, producing a decent sort of performance without being exceptional. Shame there''s no 3.5mm socket on the phone or a headphone adapter to upgrade your earwear. Bluetooth stereo headphones are another option, however.</p>\n<p>An FM radio is onboard is an alternative music source; the headset has to be plugged in, but you can play through the loudspeaker, should you wish to enjoy that tinny tiny sound system.</p>\n<p><strong>Slow browsing<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Without 3G or Wi-Fi to speed browsing along, the KC780''s online experience isn''t particularly exciting.</p>\n<p>The browser onboard provides a run-of-the-mill mobile internet set-up that''s limited but does an OK sort of job for mobile-optimised sites. It can be slow to load pages though. Email is among the messaging options, with the onboard document viewer software doing an efficient job at opening attachments in Word, Excel, text, PowerPoint and PDF file formats.</p>\n<p>Alongside this there''s a regular helping of organiser tools, such as calendar, calculator, memo, convertor, alarms, world clock and stopwatch. A bunch of LG''s M-Toy motion-controlled games make the most out of the phone''s accelerometer; darts, fishing, baseball, hammer-throwing, a maze and a magic ball are there for the shaking. They''re a bit of fun, if of limited interest after a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Limited appeal<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>As well as producing decent imaging, the KC780 does the simple call-making stuff well too. Audio is loud and clear and network coverage appears reliable.</p>\n<p>Battery performance is adequate rather than exceptional; LG reckons it can deliver up to 250 hours of standby time or 3 hours of talktime. In real-life usage tests, we averaged an acceptable 3 days standby.</p>\n<p>While KC780 owners don''t have to worry about potentially battery-sapping Wi-Fi, GPS or 3G connectivity, the lack of these sort of higher-end features makes the non-camera functionality of the phone feel somewhat underwhelming.</p>\n<p>It puts in a satisfactory performance within its limitations, but a lot of the attraction of the LG KC780 rests on whether the 8-megapixel camera swings it for you. And whilst it produces very good images for a mobile, the camera''s shooting performance didn''t blow us away enough to make it a must-buy option over better-featured but lower pixel-count rivals.</p>', '', 'lgkc7802-160-80.jpg', 'LG_kc780_2-623-80.jpg', NULL, 'Having been quick on the draw with its first', 'Having been quick on the draw with its first UK 8-megapixel mobile sharp shooter, the Renoir KC910, LG has now doubled its 8-million pixel cameraphone line-up with the release of the', '28/07/2014', 1, 3),

Its brushed silver and plastic exterior is standard slider territory, with a basic array of a D-pad, two hot keys and call/end buttons being the only items to sully the front of the handset.</p>\n<p>With such minimal controls, 3 would have done well to use less space and afford more room to the screen (it''s a 2.2-incher), given the phone''s online credentials. A built-in accelerometer allowing you to view web pages in landscape mode does help get round this problem – as does downloading the Opera Mini browser which makes better use of limited areas.</p>\n<p>The absence of a full QWERTY keyboard is also a strange omission for such a communication-centric device. That said, the current keypad layout makes use of big, tactile buttons so tapping out missives is no real problem – especially for those fluent in T9.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy navigation<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>3 has built on the success of its Skypephone and lifted the user-friendly carousel menu navigation, providing a single switcher button to scroll through the icons on the home screen.</p>\n<p>Importantly you can switch between apps without logging out, so you can go between IM chats or web browsing to making a phone call.</p>\n<p>There''s also the option to load up widgets – so popular on the iPhone – direct on your home screen, so you can check info like world times or feeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Heavenly social</strong></p>\n<p>The Skypephone may have brought 3 moderate acclaim, but for mainstream appeal a bigger hitter was needed – and no one hits a home run like Facebook. But rather than simply offering a dedicated Facebook app, 3 has taken the idea a step further and built the handset around the app rather than the other way round.</p>\n<p>Logging in for the first time, you''re invited to integrate your contacts in one central location with your phone, Skype and IM contacts. Receive a call and you''ll see your caller''s profile picture, with their various contact details amalgamated under one name.</p>\n<p>It''s one of the slickest Facebook apps we''ve seen, letting you see your profile wall and offering access to your photos, contacts and inbox. Even better, once you''ve logged in you''ll automatically have updates pushed to your phone so you''ll know immediately if someone emails you.</p>\n<p><strong>Mixed messages<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Like contacts, messages are also amalgamated so any emails you receive via Facebook will be displayed along with your SMS messages and IM threads. There''s also the opportunity to text via Skype, as well as the ability to make free Skype-to-Skype VoIP calls – an increasingly attractive prospect for a public tightening their belts.</p>\n<p>As well as being a far more effective way of organising contacts, the INQ1 also has an ace up its sleeve as within the list it also lets you see who is online, so you can contact them by either Facebook, Windows IM or Skype.</p>\n<p><strong>Multimedia features</strong></p>\n<p>Tight integration with web apps may be the INQ1''s raison d''etre, but it also obliges in providing the features expected of any self-respecting mobile phone. A 3.2-megapixel camera is provided so you can upload your party snaps, as they happen, to Facebook. Unfortunately, though, there''s no flash so capturing details in darker locations is a problem.</p>\n<p>The dedicated music player is basic, and you''ll have to store tracks to a removable microSD card due to the lack of onboard memory. There is, however, a link to let you log in to a Last.fm account to add a touch of variety to your tunage. Quality is acceptable although not on a par with more music-oriented handsets. It''s not helped by the lack of a 3.5mm jack or adaptor, meaning you''ll have to make do with the supplied headset or utilise the Bluetooth A2DP support and invest in a wireless set.</p>\n<p>One of the big boons to many of 3''s handsets, including the INQ1, is their ability to double as a tethered modem. This means you can hook the phone up to your laptop PC or Mac on the move and make use of its HSDPA data connection to access the internet; just make sure you don''t exceed your data allowance if you don''t want to pay through the nose. It''s also worth bearing in mind there''s no support for Wi-Fi – though that''s not really a big surprise at this price point .</p>\n<p><strong>Sound performance</strong></p>\n<p>Accessing the INQ1''s various web apps is helped by HSDPA support, although in areas not covered by the faster data speeds loading pages can be susceptible to hanging. Sound quality on calls was good on the whole, and battery life was above average. However, avid Facebookers will find that constant 3G and HSDPA use will inevitably drain the battery much quicker.</p>\n<p>For a first foray into the mobile phone market, INQ has excelled in producing a handset that offers such intuitive integration with existing online communities. Affordable, easy to use and a genuinely useful tool, the INQ1 is perfect for those who don''t need the sophistication of a smartphone but still demand an element of syncing with their digital lives.</p>\n<p>Admittedly the odd corner has been cut and the INQ1 won''t win any style awards, but for £80 on pay as you go there is little room for criticism.</p>', '', 'inq1handset204-218-85-160-80.jpg', 'facebook-phone1.jpg', NULL, 'Better known as the Facebook phone, 3''s latest', 'Better known as the Facebook phone, 3''s latest addition to its roster – the INQ1 – has a unique agenda to offer seamless social networking to all.

Its features include an MP3 player and FM radio plus a 2-megapixel camera, and it supports MicroSD card expansion, but doesn''t have any of the high-end stuff like Wi-Fi, GPS or multi-gigabyte memory.</p>\n<p>Instead, much of what makes this phone stand out happens directly under the flip lid. It has large, finger-friendly numberpad keys with big, easy-to-read characters, while the control panel is similarly well spread for comfortable keying. This is a phone that''s meant to be easy to use.</p>\n<p>Running with that theme, LG has stuck four additional hotkey buttons under the phone''s display, giving users quick and obvious access to handy functions, with each of them labelled with symbols for specific purposes - Alarm clock, Calendar, Images, and Favourites (a user-definable list of most-wanted apps).</p>\n<p>And out of the box, LG goes easy on the eyesight with extra large fonts set as default for the menu system – though this can be easily changed if your prefer.</p>\n<p><strong>Understated phone</strong></p>\n<p>The KF300 is no super-skinny flip phone. It has a substantial footprint, measuring 98.8(h) x 49.5(w) x 16.2(d)mm, and weighing 97g. Of course this gives it enough room for the expansive numberpad and extra buttonry, though the screen under the flip is still an average 2.2-inch QVGA 262K-colour affair.</p>\n<p>On the outside, the casing is mature-smart rather than stylish, with rubber-feel black bodywork with chrome-look trim, and a reflective front panel fully covered by a sheet of plastic.</p>\n<p>Its understated shell hides a secondary external display on the flip, which lights up when the flip''s opened, providing caller info too when a call or text comes in. The camera perches neatly on top of the fascia on a chrome strip.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple menus </strong></p>\n<p>Although designed to go easy on eye-work, the matt black numberpad is easy on the eye too. The number keys are simply arranged, are a good size for error-free punching, and are firm and responsive for texting and number tapping.</p>\n<p>The controls, built around a large navigation pad laid out in conventional phone style, are roomy too. It has shortcuts on the directional keys, which can be user defined if required, icons for which are displayed onscreen (they can be switched off if desired).</p>\n<p>Although LG has scaled up certain elements and added buttons, it hasn''t reinvented or oversimplified the control system underpinning the KF300 – it''s very much familiar LG stuff we''ve seen before. The main menu, laid out in gird format, leads to further sub-menu lists, which can be scrolled through to select, or selected quickly by pressing the appropriate number key next to the option.</p>\n<p><strong>Handy hotkeys<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>In practice, this makes it pretty straightforward for anyone familiar with conventional phone layouts to get to grips with, while the extra shortcut buttons make life easier for those who just want to access certain functions quickly.</p>\n<p>The Favourites hotkey button under the screen is a particularly handy one, which can be set up easily as a fast access list for as many as 12 features or apps of your choosing, from Bluetooth or games to radio or vibrate alert. Useful if you want to skip delving into the menus for most-used functions.</p>\n<p>Although these hotkeys are practical, the positioning of them may initially get some users inadvertently pressing them rather than the softkeys next to the navigation pad when selecting onscreen softkey options. The hotkeys sit almost directly under the screen options, so at first it''s natural to reach for them rather than look to the lower half of the phone. You soon get used to it, however.</p>\n<p>Some may prefer a larger menu font, but we tended towards the more practical normal sized, which makes it easier for menu browsing and seeing selection options. We''d have also preferred more choice of simplified fonts for number dialling, as the standard LG ones used here are too tacky or quirky for such a middle of the road phone.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic snapper</strong></p>\n<p>The LG KF300 has a serviceable set of additional features, without any real stand-out applications.</p>\n<p>The 2-megapixel camera is a run-of-the-mill, low specced shooter. It''s fired up from the D-pad, with shots framed and taken in portrait mode, with the viewfinder showing the image in a band across the screen (or unsatisfactorily cropping bits of the image if you go for full screen mode).</p>\n<p>With this sort of camera, without flash or autofocus system, you get what you''d expect; image quality is limited. It''s fine for quick snaps, and reasonable within its point-and-shoot fixed focus limitations, but shots aren''t particularly detailed and colour performance is sometimes muted in lower light conditions. In darker conditions, image quality is poor.</p>\n<p>Video capture doesn''t impress much either. Shooting at average QVGA maximum resolution, footage is typically low-grade mobile quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Stingy storage<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The KF300''s music player software does an acceptable job of playing back tunes, although you''ll need to slot in a MicroSD memory card if you''re to fully enjoy its functionality, as the phone has a mere 14MB of internal storage. You don''t get one in-box, but as MicroSDs are now pretty cheap, it''s an inexpensive recommended upgrade if you want to load up more than a couple of tracks.</p>\n<p>The music player interface is functional and a little basic looking, but easy enough for anyone to operate using the D-pad controls.</p>\n<p>Copying over tracks isn''t helped by the absence of a USB cable in-box, though it''s possible to Bluetooth them over from a PC or phone, or copy onto an aforementioned MicroSD card.</p>\n<p><strong>Shouty speaker<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The supplied earphones are a pleasant surprise, however, with a quite well balanced performance including reasonably good bass – and come with a 3.5mm standard headphone adapter socket on the two-part headset, so you can add your own better quality earwear easily enough.</p>\n<p>The headset, which plugs into the side-mounted multi-connector port on the phone, is necessary for using the phone''s decent quality FM radio, though it can also be played through the loudspeaker – which can be cranked up pretty loud (albeit with the usual tinniness).</p>\n<p>Other features are predictable for a phone of this class, with organiser functionality such as calendar, convertor, memo and to do lists, various clock functions, voice recorder, plus email alongside text and MMS messaging.</p>\n<p>There''s a standard Wap browser for mobile internet perusal; links for the Orange World content and information portal are provided on Orange models. A couple of sensible games, backgammon and chess, also add to the sedate features list.</p>\n<p><strong>Battery life </strong></p>\n<p>One of the advantages of a more low-key features set is the relative lack of potentially power-draining, tempting-to-play-with features that you get on higher-end models.</p>\n<p>Still, with no 3G and a down-range set of features, LG''s quoted optimum battery life of up to 200 hours on standby or talktime of up to 2 hours is quite low; we''d have expected a lot higher for a non-3G handset. In typical usage tests, however, we managed to keep the phone operational for up to 3 days with little music playback and average amounts of calls and texts.</p>\n<p>The performance on voice calls was dependably good, with no problems during our tests, and clear, loud speech through the earpiece.</p>\n<p><strong>Low-key mobile phone<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Although it''s grabbed headline with some head-turning handsets, the LG KF300 is a more modest sort of handset that''s not aimed at the gadget-loving mobile buyer.</p>\n<p>Its low level features list covers the basics without much to excite, and its flip phone look is steady rather than stunning. Its chief attraction is the added usability layered on a familiar LG user interface experience, with that large clear numberpad and easy-access hotkeys bound to appeal to some users.</p>\n<p>While it may not be one for everyone''s mobile phone wish list, there''s certainly a market for this sort of low-key handset.</p>', '', 'lg20kf300-160-80.jpg', 'LG_KF300-623-80.jpg', NULL, 'It''s not always about how much high-tech', 'It''s not always about how much high-tech gadgetry you can squeeze in.

Below it are a circular D-pad surrounded by two soft keys, call start/stop buttons and home and back keys.</p>\n<p>The numerical keypad is well-spaced though the keys are flat and not easily distinguished under the thumb. Around the sides are volume buttons and a camera shutter button, something not usually found on HTC devices.</p>\n<p>Unusually, the SIM card and microSD memory card reside together in a small compartment revealed when the keyboard is opened. You have to remove the SIM to get to the memory card, which is a nuisance if you''re likely to swap your memory cards regularly.</p>\n<p><strong>Fantastic keyboard<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>As with other HTC smart phones, this is a Windows Mobile handset, though the OS is relegated to the background by HTC''s nifty-looking ''sliding panels'' interface, which presents the most popular apps with some fancy graphics.</p>\n<p>But the star of this particular show is the slide-out QWERTY keyboard, which is a mini marvel. It has four rows of keys (the Touch Pro has five) so you''ll need to press the FN key to get the numbers, but that''s no hardship. There are direction keys, two soft keys and shortcuts for email and text message applications. The keys are of rubberised plastic and are raised in the middle, making them very easy to find under your thumbs when you''re texting, emailing or instant messaging.</p>\n<p>Snapping out the keyboard automatically realigns the screen into landscape mode, which offers the best resolution for viewing web pages (something several recent Touch models have lacked the ability to do). Browsing the web is a breeze using the D-pad to move around pages and the keyboard to input info.</p>\n<p>The zoom control is a bit basic, in that it only offers on or off, without any increments, though there is also the option to fit pages to the screen size or to rearrange the page into a single column. There are RSS feeds and web access isn''t a problem with the S740''s fast 3G HSDPA (up to 7Mbps download) connection as well as Wi-Fi if you need broadband.</p>\n<p><strong>Speedy camera<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The 3.2 megapixel camera is better than most we''ve tried on other HTC devices. It''s very quick to start up (a little under two seconds), making it ideal for quick snaps. There''s no flash or autofocus but pictures in good light held a fair amount of detail, even if the colours tended to look a little washed out.</p>\n<p>Any movement tended to blur all too easily however, as it did with video. The panorama feature is a good one, allowing you to take three photos with each lightly superimposed on the next to help you build up a panoramic image.</p>\n<p>HTC''s Audio Manager music player displays cover art where available and includes a ten-band graphic equaliser, which you can adjust manually or via the 21 presets. There''s also an FM radio on board with nine channel presets for which you''ll need to add the supplied headphones, though you can also listen via the built-in loudspeaker.</p>\n<p>The headphone sound isn''t great, sounding ''shut-in'' and without much bass – unfortunately you''ll need a USB adaptor to be able to add a better pair of ''phones.</p>\n<p><strong>Fully-featured smartphone<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>A-GPS is on board supported by Google Maps, and didn''t have any trouble finding our north London bolthole. This being a Windows Mobile handset there are lots of other map and sat-nav options you can add (for a price) though a screen with these modest dimensions wouldn''t be ideal for an in-car sat-nav.</p>\n<p>Windows Office is on board too, though unlike other recent HTC models it''s the basic version which allows you to view or edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents but not create them.</p>\n<p>Battery life was very good for a smart phone, giving us a good two and a half days of moderate use.</p>\n<p>It''s not the best looking handset in HTC''s range, but it has one of the best slide-out QWERTY keyboards we''ve used, a good browser, fine music player, half-decent 3.2 megapixel camera, A-GPS and the versatility of Windows Mobile, all in a slim, pocket-friendly package.</p>', '', 'htc20s740-160-80.jpg', 'HTC_S740-623-80.jpg', NULL, 'HTC''s last QWERTY keyboard phone was a well', 'HTC''s last QWERTY keyboard phone was a well specced hulk of a thing that could fill any pocket.

Which doesn''t mean they''re bad – they offer a reasonably convincing and controlled soundstage, though they''re a bit lacking in bass.</p>\n<p>If you feel the need to upgrade them, as usual for Walkman mobiles, the phone comes with a standard 3.5mm headphone jack adaptor which plugs into the regular Sony Ericsson multi-connector charging port.</p>\n<p><strong>Music player presets<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The shake control from the W302''s big brothers is missing (not that we felt the loss of this gimmicky accessory) as is the SensMe search function based on what mood you''re in, but more useful is the five-band graphic equaliser which can be adjusted manually or using one of the ten preset levels.</p>\n<p>The rather marvellous TrackID feature is also present, which allows you to identify mystery tracks your hear around you or on the W302''s FM radio (or any other sound source come to that). With only 20MB of memory on board you''ll need the 512MB Memory Stick Micro card that comes with it, though you can expand this up to 4GB.</p>\n<p>There are only nine presets on the radio and no automatic search. You''ll need to scroll through the frequencies manually to find stations – this was really the only point at which we felt let down by the music content of the Sony Ericsson W302.</p>\n<p><strong>Limited camera</strong></p>\n<p>The 2 megapixel camera won''t win any awards, but it''s better than many others we''ve tried with a similar spec.</p>\n<p>It''s very quick to get into via the shutter button on the side (less than two seconds) and offers a reasonable set of options, including a picture resolution up to 1600x1200 pixels, a 2.5x digital zoom, timer (5, 10 or 15 seconds), night mode (there''s no flash) and a burst mode which takes four pics in quick succession.</p>\n<p>Picture quality is reasonable within the camera''s obvious limitations and with good light and reasonably static subjects it takes perfectly decent snaps. Video, as you might expect, isn''t up to the standard of the stills and isn''t really worth bothering about unless movement is on the slow side and in very good light.</p>\n<p><strong>Sluggish browsing<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>It''s a quad-band phone, which makes it ideal for travelling, but unfortunately there''s no 3G connection, and no Wi-Fi either, so the browser is really only much use in an emergency, and you''ll need a bit of patience if you''re downloading tracks or games. It comes with two 3D games incidentally – 3D Rollercoaster and Sony Ericsson warhorse Quadrapop.</p>\n<p>The battery stood up well to our moderate phone and music playing use, giving us a good three days including about an hour and a half of music play.</p>\n<p>We like phones to do what they say they can, rather than promising us the earth and drowning in a sea of half-baked features and muddled functionality.</p>\n<p>The Sony Ericsson W302 gives you a very good music player in a petite slimline casing, with a cheap but better than average camera and, limited internet facilities.

(16, 'Sony Ericsson C905 review', 'sony-ericsson-c905-review', 'Don Miller', 'Techradar', 'The Sony Ericsson Cyber-shot range has a powerful new flagship in the shape of the hot-shot 8.1-megapixel C905', '&#160;', '<p>Packing in a class-topping 8.1-megapixel camera, the Sony Ericsson C905 is the new flagship model in its Cyber-shot cameraphone range.</p>\n<p>Lined up against recent 8-megapixel sharp-shooting cameraphones from Samsung (the Pixon and i8510) and LG (the Renoir and KC780), the Sony Ericsson C905 comes out fighting with HSDPA 3G and Wi-Fi connectivity, A-GPS positioning technology and Sat Nav software onboard.</p>\n<p>In addition, the user-friendly Cyber-shot camera set-up includes a high quality xenon flash to go with the gadgetry inside.</p>\n<p>What it doesn''t have is the smartphone functionality of the i8510 or touchscreen control capability of the Renoir and Pixon. Nonetheless, the C905 does have a solid line-up of familiar Sony Ericsson feature-phone applications, including music and video players, Google Maps software, a full web browser and an FM radio.</p>\n<p><strong>Chunky design</strong></p>\n<p>The Sony Ericsson C905 is the first Cyber-shot sliderphone, and it''s a solid, substantial design. Weighing 136g, it''s on the heavyweight side, and with a profile that goes from 18mm to 19.5mm where the camera bulges, it''s certainly no slimline model like the 5-megapixel C902.</p>\n<p>With a rubber feel and metal casing, plus scratch resistant glass covering the screen, it feels reassuringly well built, and the numberpad slider mechanism is smoothly sprung and sturdy. Another well-crafted brushed metal slider on the back protects the camera from dust and scratches. It slips down to activate the camera too.</p>\n<p>Despite the chunkiness, it''s an attractive design, with a definite camera look and feel to the device when held sideways in camera shooting mode. Its solidity also gives it a nicely balanced feel when shooting.</p>\n<p><strong>Large controls<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The display is a decently-sized 2.4-inch QVGA, 262K-colour screen, which provides ample viewfinder space. It''s not as large as the displays of its 8-megapixel rivals, but it is bright and clear. An in-built accelerometer automatically switches screen orientation in certain media functions to match how you''re looking at the display.</p>\n<p>The control set-up is based around a square navigation D-pad, with columns of buttons on either side, for a conventional Sony Ericsson navigation experience. The buttons are close and smooth, so don''t feel quite roomy enough for the heavier-fingered user. Controls are generally responsive though.</p>\n<p>The numberpad buttons on the slider are large enough, though they do feel a tad spongey for really speedy texting. They''re also not the best defined numbers we''ve seen; although rows are adequately separated by chrome trim, only light bumps under the surface identify individual number buttons on the rows.</p>\n<p>There''s no secondary front-facing video call camera on this phone for face-to-face calling (though you can make video calls using the main camera on the back if you want to).</p>\n<p><strong>Simple camera operation<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Around the top of the screen are two buttons that double up as gaming keys, but come into play as camera control buttons when the shooter''s activated. Blue glowing camera control icons on these, and also on the D-pad, represent hotkey options for camera functions.</p>\n<p>The Cyber-shot camera user interface is easy to use, with the dedicated control keys offering fast access to certain functions, plus additional layers of settings to refine your shooting settings.</p>\n<p>The C905''s autofocus system is a no-fuss, 2-step shutter button operated set-up that works efficiently. There are additional macro options for close-up shots, which can come out great, plus a face detection option that can lock onto up to three faces in a shot to help get sharp images of people. This works quite smartly too.</p>\n<p>It doesn''t have all of the focusing gadgetry found on rival 8-megapixel cameraphones, such as blink detection or smile shot, or the touch focus used on the Renoir, but it does have Sony Ericsson''s very clever BestPic option. This enables you to take a burst of seven shots when you click the camera button, including shots buffered just before you press it as well as after, from which you can select the best image.</p>\n<p><strong>Sharp snapper<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The 8.1-megapixel camera offers a step-up in shooting potential on this model. Images are sharp, clear and detailed, with good colour rendition and plenty of richness to shots.</p>\n<p>Exposure is handled well, and there''s an additional Smart contrast option to enhance levels in demanding lighting conditions. It''s a cracking performance from a cameraphone.</p>\n<p>The xenon flash ups the shooting performance in low-light and dark conditions, filling scenes with plenty of light without overpowering subjects, and offering good illumination over a larger range than most weedy cameraphone LED flashes.</p>\n<p>Red-eye reduction is available too. It''s a very welcome component of the C905''s shooting armoury.</p>\n<p><strong>Smooth videos<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>A goodly selection of shooting adjustments can me made to the responsive auto metering system. Scene settings give you options for different environments or snapping requirements, plus there are white balance and exposure tweaking options.Typical mobile colour effects and frames can be added too.</p>\n<p>Among the more detailed settings you can switch on an image stabiliser, and usefully, there''s an Add Position option for geo-tagging pics with the aid of the A-GPS system – so you can view them superimposed over a map of where they were taken on the phone''s Google Maps app, or on a suitable online service or desktop application.</p>\n<p>Both images and video can be tweaked after shooting, and there''s a fast blogging option as soon as you''ve captured shots. Video shooting is similar quality to the C902''s – QVGA at 30 frames per second, so is smooth but not such great resolution as LG and Samsung''s rival 8-megapixel devices. It looks OK in fullscreen mode on the phone, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Location finding</strong></p>\n<p>A-GPS is another standout feature that does a decent job on the C905. It''s allied with the Google Maps application that''s recently become a Sony Ericsson mid-tier staple feature, adding precise position finding to that very useful mapping, route finding and search application.</p>\n<p>Google Maps is handy to get location-based info, but isn''t a full Sat Nav set-up. Instead, Sony Ericsson includes Wayfinder Navigator 7 Sat Nav software pre-loaded – or at least a three-month trial version of the software.</p>\n<p>Using over the air updating, you can get 2D and 3D route planning and turn-buy-turn guidance, including voice directions. It''s another useful software addition, and is sophisticated for a feature phone. It''s not, however, as function-laden and smooth an experience as some of the better smartphone Sat Nav memory card-based packages, or an in-car kit, relying on over-the-air updates of maps and info rather than having it pre-loaded.</p>\n<p>The A-GPS system works effectively, though, and is fairly quick to get a positional fix when fired up. Another Sony Ericsson app, NearMe, is pre-loaded too for location-based local area information about entertainment, services and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Music and video player</strong></p>\n<p>Although Sony Ericsson tends to keep the best elements of its Walkman music mobiles and Cyber-shot cameraphones apart, the C905 is capable of putting in a very acceptable tune playing performance.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, unlike on high-tier Walkman phones, the supplied earphones are pretty average. And as there''s no standard 3.5mm headphone socket on the phone, or 3.5mm adapter with the in-box headset, you''ll need to source an adapter yourself or use a spare Walkman set to get the best possible sound quality. Out of the box, audio quality does sound acceptable if not out of the ordinary, but with better earphones, the performance is distinctly improved.</p>\n<p>Sony Ericsson boxes a 2GB Memory Stick Micro memory card with the C905, giving you a bit of legroom for adding tracks as well as handling large image files generated by the high resolution camera. Onboard available memory is 160MB, so a card is needed. Higher capacity cards up to 8GB are supported on this phone.</p>\n<p>An easy to use FM radio is included too, and the latest version of Sony Ericsson''s TrackID song identification software is embedded.</p>\n<p><strong>Online activity</strong></p>\n<p>With Wi-Fi connectivity onboard you can get high-speed data connectivity from home Wi-Fi set-ups, work networks or public access hotspots – ideal if you want to download content online without incurring mobile data costs, or upload content such as videos or high res images speedily (and cheaply). It''s easy to set up and use in just a few button clicks.</p>\n<p>Mobile HSDPA connectivity gives fast mobile data access too – offering maximum downlink rates of up to 3.6Mbp. The full web browser is similar to other Sony Ericssons, so provides a familiar, straightforward to use home screen and a reasonable (if not iPhone-like) web-browsing experience for this class of handset.</p>\n<p>Streaming or downloading audio or video from mobile network operator services is supported too, and is suitably quick to do. You can also easily copy content from a PC to the phone using supplied Media Manager software and a USB cable, or by dragging and dropping in mass storage mode, or via Bluetooth. A USB memory card reader is in-box too for quick copying straight to a card.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional features</strong></p>\n<p>Alongside the higher-spec gadgetry, Sony Ericsson has packed in a good helping of typical mid-tier software. Its organiser and messaging functionality ticks the right boxes, including email support, calendar, alarms, tasks, notes, voice recorder, world clock, timer, stopwatch, calculator and a code memo function.</p>\n<p>An AccuWeather.com app provides web-based weather updates and forecasts too, and three games come pre-loaded.</p>\n<p><strong>Top notch cameraphone<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Sony Ericsson scores highly on the essentials of voice calling, with a high quality, clear performance on call in a variety of conditions.</p>\n<p>We were less enthralled by the battery performance, with some heavy juice-using features such as GPS, Wi-Fi and the xenon camera flash accelerating the run-down times in our tests. In optimum network conditions, Sony Ericsson reckons it can achieve 360-380 hours standby or talktime of 4 hours on 3G networks or 9 hours on GSM. We found ourselves having to charge most days, though, if we used the high-ticket features regularly.</p>\n<p>Raising the bar for its Cyber-shot range, Sony Ericsson''s 8.1-megapixel Cyber-shot phone is a highly attractive option for those with a strong in interest in high quality cameraphone images. It produces very presentable printable shots, with the xenon flash adding extra power to low-light shooting.</p>\n<p>As an all-round handset, the Sony Ericsson C905 may not have the feature punch of a top-end smartphone and is certainly no slimline pocketful. But Wi-Fi and A-GPS technology do add some extra high-end appeal to superb cameraphone package.</p>', '', 'c905front-800x600-160-80.jpg', 'C905_Front-800x600-623-80.jpg', NULL, 'Packing in a class-topping 8.1-megapixel', 'Packing in a class-topping 8.1-megapixel camera, the Sony Ericsson C905 is the new flagship model in its Cyber-shot cameraphone range.Lined up against recent 8-megapixel sharp-shooting', '28/07/2014', 1, 3),

There''s no 3G, though there is Wi-Fi, and there''s no GPS and no headphones. There''s not much in the way of onboard memory either, with just 256MB, though there''s a microSD slot underneath the battery.</p>\n<p>The HTC Touch Viva is different from other Touches in that the touch screen is recessed a couple of millimetres from the phone''s casing. While this might provide some protection against scratches if you lay it down on its face, it has the effect of making it more difficult to use.</p>\n<p>It''s hard to activate the touch screen at the sides with your finger or thumb, meaning you have to rely on the side-mounted stylus. It''s not a disaster, but it can be a nuisance, especially when you want to activate a scroll bar in a hurry.</p>\n<p>That aside, the TouchFLO interface that sits on top of the Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional OS is still a winner, making it easy to organise your favourite apps. It doesn''t look quite as flashy as the 3D version available on the higher end models, but it does the job well enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy browsing<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The decision not to include 3G is a strange one, not least because the Viva''s web browser is one of its main strengths.</p>\n<p>The default browser is Opera (though you can use Explorer if you really must) and you can pan around pages by brushing the screen with your fingertip.</p>\n<p>Zooming is easy using the zoom scroll bar and it''s only a shame that there''s no option to view pages in landscape mode (unless you''re watching videos via the YouTube app).</p>\n<p><strong>Basic camera<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The camera is only of the 2 megapixel variety, so lagging well behind the Touch HD''s 5 megapixel snapper (which actually isn''t as good as it should be).</p>\n<p>There''s no flash and it doesn''t handle movement well but brightly lit still pics come out okay. It''s unlikely you''ll bother much with the video camera though, since blurring seems to be the norm rather than the exception.</p>\n<p>Viewing your still pics afterwards however is a joy since the HTC pic browser lets you zoom in or out by drawing circles with your finger around the point you want to zoom in on, and you can move on to the next pic by brushing your finger across the screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Punchy music player<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The music player is similar to other Touches and it''s a fine piece of software, kicking out a decent whack via the loudspeaker. But there''s no headphones, and no 3.5mm headphone jack which would have made it easier to add your own pair, so you''ll need to get a mini USB adaptor if you want to use this device for music.</p>\n<p>Battery life is pretty good for this class of phone, and it gave us a good three days of moderate use before recharging.</p>\n<p><strong>Limited appeal<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The lowest specced contender in any range is always going to suffer from comparison with its peers.</p>\n<p>The HTC Touch Viva could have been better if its positioning had been a bit clearer – if it''s meant for browsing, include 3G, if it''s music, give it some headphones, if it''s for watching video, make sure you can view them in widescreen.</p>\n<p>It may find a niche as a cut-price Windows Mobile device given out to corporate drones, but the rest of us are likely to find it too frustrating that it''s not a Pro, or an HD, or a Diamond…</p>', '', 'viva20touch-160-80.jpg', 'Viva_Touch-623-80.jpg', NULL, 'Taiwan''s HTC has been pumping out variations', 'Taiwan''s HTC has been pumping out variations on its Touch theme touch-operated devices with striking regularity this year, including the G1 (Google phone), iPhone-alike Touch HD, svelte but', '28/07/2014', 1, 3),

What will those clever folks at RIM think of next?</p>\n<p>Actually, the only surprise about the first BlackBerry clamshell is that it took so long coming.</p>\n<p>The Pearl series has been RIM''s attempt to break the BlackBerry out of the boardroom ghetto and into the pockets and handbags of people who don''t necessarily need them for work.</p>\n<p>It was only a matter of time before they moved into the flip form factor.</p>\n<p><strong>Chic styling<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Eschewing the bright and populist style of previous Pearls, the Flip goes for a sober, but not boring, gloss black (or red), which manages the trick of looking both chic and serious.</p>\n<p>There''s a 27x34mm (128 x 160 pixels) outer screen which is almost invisible when in repose, but when lit displays a rather macho looking analogue clock with date, plus battery, signal, message and caller information. Above it is the 2-megapixel camera lens surrounded by LED photo light and alert light, which helps with the symmetry.</p>\n<p>Around the sides are two programmable ''convenience keys'' plus volume buttons, microSD card slot (there''s no card supplied but it will hold up to 16GB to complement the 128MB of onboard memory), USB charging port, 3.5mm headphone jack and a sound mute button (handy if you do happen to find yourself in a board meeting, and also for cutting the music player temporarily).</p>\n<p><strong>Large keys<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Flip it open and the keyboard is immediately obvious as the prince of the Pearls. While its cousins make do with rather fiddly, small buttons, the Flip''s are large and very easy to use, especially for texting or emailing.</p>\n<p>The keys are laid out in QWERTY fashion with two letters per key, as is the BlackBerry SureType way, and which can take a bit of getting used to if you''re not already a BlackBerry convert. But after a few minutes you''ll be texting away like a pro, either in multitap or predictive mode.</p>\n<p>The 240x320 pixel screen is sharp and reasonably detailed, doing a good job of displaying the pics from the 2-megapixel camera. It''s certainly not in the front running for phone-borne cameras, but as with most things about this phone, it makes the best of what it has.</p>\n<p>Resolution may be only up to 1600x1200 but you can access the camera in less than two seconds and you can have a snap taken in less than four – just about as fast as you''ll get on a cameraphone.</p>\n<p><strong>Decent feature set</strong></p>\n<p>Pics are fine if you think of them as snaps rather than works of art – they could be sharper, colours could be a bit richer but they''re fine if you''re in a hurry. Video resolution isn''t quite as good, but in good light, if movement isn''t too fast, it holds up well.</p>\n<p>The Flip''s music player is pretty decent too. It''ll play all the main audio formats and includes a 12-setting graphic equaliser for optimising your sound.</p>\n<p>The supplied headphones are a cut above the usual cheapies (though they don''t match those from Sony Ericsson, for example) but the 3.5mm headphone jack means an upgrade is as easy as could be.</p>\n<p><strong>Handy connectivity<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>There''s a choice of BlackBerry and Google Maps onboard for finding your way around, but no GPS, so it relies on cell site triangulation to pinpoint your position. Since it''s only accurate to within 500 metres, you''ll find yourself aching for a genuine GPS transmitter, which incidentally, you can attach via Bluetooth.</p>\n<p>It''s quad band but there''s no 3G, which limits its usefulness for browsing. If you can get a Wi-Fi connection however the browser is actually quite decent, the BlackBerry trackball allowing you to pan around pages with ease and just a tap required to zoom in. The column view option is also useful since you can''t view pages in landscape mode.</p>\n<p>Other apps include Facebook (okay for emergencies, but you''ll prefer to use your computer whenever possible) and document viewers. Battery life was decent, giving us a good two days of moderate use, even with Wi-Fi switched on for most of that time.</p>\n<p>Overall, it''s a great little handset that plays to its strengths – mail and text are of course the stars of the show, with camera, music player and document readers all offering decent support in a good-looking and highly efficient package.</p>\n<p><strong>Network availability:</strong> O2, others TBC</p>\n<p><strong>Looks:</strong> 3.5/5<br />\n<strong>Ease of use:</strong> 3.5/5<br />\n<strong>Features:</strong> 3.5/5<br />\n<strong>Call quality:</strong> 4/5<br />\n<strong>Value for money: </strong>3.5/5</p>', '', 'blackberry8220-160-80.jpg', 'Blackberry8220-623-80.jpg', NULL, 'A clamshell BlackBerry?

The UK currently has no similar DVB-H services available or imminent, mainly due to a number of technical and regulatory issues.</p>\n<p>It looks very similar to the N95 too but closer inspection reveals that it''s slightly longer and wider, but also thinner and lighter than its predecessor; it''s still on the chunky side, but not quite as much.</p>\n<p>While the original N95 was hailed as a superphone on its arrival, it quickly gained a reputation for buggyness, slow operation and a tendency to crash. Since then, software upgrades with the N95 and N95 8GB have solved these issues, and on our brief acquaintance with the new N96 model, its seems to be fine as far as reliability is concerned.</p>\n<p><strong>Sharp camera</strong></p>\n<p>The case slides up to reveal the keypad, and slides down to reveal a set of dedicated media player controls, flipping into landscape mode as it does so. But while this feature was present on the N95, the N96 has added an additional set of hidden media player controls around the D-pad/scroll wheel, which light up when you''re in multimedia mode.</p>\n<p>The 5 megapixel camera has the same Carl Zeiss lens as the N95 and takes a very good snap, showed off to good effect on the sharp and bright 16 million colour screen. This version has a brighter flash with two LEDs instead of one – it''s not exactly blinding, but does give you a bit more scope in low light conditions, especially for video.</p>\n<p>There''s also a secondary camera on the front for video-conferencing.</p>\n<p><strong>Smooth video playback<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Your pictures can be automatically geotagged, which of course means that there''s A-GPS on board, backed up by Nokia Maps, which works very well indeed, though you can also download Google Maps to take advantage of that system''s aerial photographs.</p>\n<p>Video playback at 30fps (video recording can also be set at this level) is generally smooth and there''s a fold-out stand on the back (which doubles as the frame for the camera lens and flash) so you can set it up on a desk for watching mini widescreen viewing.</p>\n<p>It works, but there''s no real option to adjust the angle it sits at. Incidentally, when it''s positioned this way, the stereo speakers sit on top at each end of the phone – ideal positioning in other words.</p>\n<p><strong>Intuitive music player<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The web browser, whether it be connecting through the fast-ish HSDPA 3G connection (up to 3.6Mbps) or the fastest Wi-Fi link, is decent if not spectacular, especially when you can flip into landscape mode and use the slide-out media player controls for streaming video or music.</p>\n<p>The music player is still a good one, easy to load up the 16GB of onboard memory with tracks from your PC or via Bluetooth and intuitively organised.</p>\n<p>The dual speakers go fairly loud though they seemed to get a bit hissily distorted at higher volume, and there''s a 3.5mm jack plug so you can upgrade the (admittedly not bad) supplied headphones.

On the sides are volume controls, power/headphone socket, camera shutter button and a programmable shortcut button with a power button on top.</p>\n<p>The screen is sensitive enough to be able to use easily and intuitively without becoming a hassle and you can perform most functions with your thumb too, though there is a stylus provided. It''s a telescopic one that sheaths into a compact case but it''s not enclosed in the case, and instead dangles from a short lanyard. Not great, but fortunately you can do without it most of the time.</p>\n<p>It''s gesture sensitive too, so you can scroll through menus by rubbing your thumb along the surface, though getting the pressure right so that you don''t accidentally activate any features takes a bit of getting used to.</p>\n<p>It offers just the right amount of haptic feedback, though you can adjust this if you prefer and even switch it off if you''re a haptic-ophobe. But while it looks great indoors, it gave us no end of trouble when we tried using it in direct sunlight.</p>\n<p><strong>Phone widgets<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Samsung''s widgets are back and they''re definitely a fun aspect of the device. Choose your favourite feature icons (email, music player, calendar, time, FM radio, contacts etc) from a column on the side, drag them onto your home screen and arrange them how you like. It''s a lovely piece of personalisation, and practical too.</p>\n<p>The Omnia runs Windows Smartphone 6.1, but sensibly, Samsung has chosen to play to that system''s strengths by keeping it largely in the background.</p>\n<p>You can benefit from all manner of programme downloads, including Pocket Office and the Opera web browser, but most of the navigation is via Samsung''s TouchWiz system. Setting up email is a doddle, as is ActiveSync with your PC, and hooking up to a local network using Wi-Fi.</p>\n<p><strong>Well-specced camera<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Next to the screen, the 5-megapixel camera is the undoubted star of the Omnia show. It''s the first Windows Mobile device we''ve seen with such a well-specced snapper and Samsung hasn''t skimped on the features. There''s auto focus, image stabilisation which helps in low light, and smile recognition, which makes the most prominent smile the focus of your shot.</p>\n<p>There are 14 pre-shot modes including panorama, which allows you take several shots together and then stitches them into a widescreen view. There''s also an averagely (ie not very) powerful LED flash which helps a little in low light if you''re close to your subject and you can upload your pics direct to your blog or content sharing website via the ShoZu application.</p>\n<p>It''s not too quick to get started (about three seconds) and the auto focus will slow you down if you''re after quick snaps, but all the finger-operated controls displayed on the screen are very nippy indeed. Pictures are generally pretty good too, though the focus could perhaps be a little sharper as a rule. You can also add geotags with the GPS system onboard (backed up by Google Maps).</p>\n<p>The quality drops a bit for video recording, which is only 15fps with a maximum resolution of 640x480, so it won''t replace your video camera.</p>\n<p>Viewing pictures is all done via finger control with easy zoom and edit options plus the ability to set up slideshows. Viewing video is at least better than shooting it, and unusually, it''ll show both DivX and Xvid formats.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy browsing</strong></p>\n<p>Browsing is a mostly sweet experience. The onboard accelerometer automatically flips between portrait and landscape (and you can adjust the sensitivity of this too, which is a nice touch). You can drag the pages around á la the iPhone and you can zoom by running your finger up or down the right-hand side of the screen, or double tap for a quick zoom in or out.</p>\n<p>It supports RSS feeds and streaming video too via HSDPA fast 3G connection. And speaking of 3G, there''s a pinhole camera on the front for video conferencing.</p>\n<p>The onscreen keyboard is a bit too similar to the iPhone''s cramped version for our taste, but flipping the phone into landscape mode offers bigger buttons, which is what we found ourselves doing even for text messages.</p>\n<p><strong>Generous memory<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>The music player is decent if not outstanding, with a wide range of formats supported. There''s no 3.5mm jack plug, but it comes with an adaptor, so no problem if you want to upgrade the supplied headphones (which aren''t bad by supplied ear bud standards).</p>\n<p>There''s a meaty 8GB of memory on board, which isn''t bad at all, though you can also augment this via microSD card.</p>\n<p>Battery-wise it seemed to hold up pretty well, delivering around three days of average use (a dozen or so calls a day, plus a half-hour''s web browsing and a little bit of music). But with haptic feedback and accelerometer switched on constantly, this depreciated markedly to around two days.</p>\n<p><strong>Feature-packed<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Samsung''s touch screen phones are improving all the time and this latest version manages to pack an awful lot into a modestly sized handset, including a very decent camera, fine web browser and music player, plus the rich third party apps available for Windows Mobile.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 3G may beat it on looks and nudge ahead on screen, but in almost every other area, the Samsung i900 Omnia can equal or better it.</p>\n<p><strong>Network availability: </strong>Vodafone, O2, Orange, T-Mobile</p>\n<p><strong>Looks:</strong> 4/5<br />\n<strong>Ease of use:</strong> 3.5/5<br />\n<strong>Features:</strong> 4.5/5<br />\n<strong>Call quality:</strong> 4/5<br />\n<strong>Value for money:</strong> 3.5/5</p>', '', 'samsungomnia-218-85-160-80.jpg', 'e25cc7fd331fdda10956969a4a10c7da.jpg', NULL, 'Samsung has been loving its iPhone-style full', 'Samsung has been loving its iPhone-style full frontal touch screens of late.

Let''s take a look through the phone''s inner workings with the Toshiba TG01 review.</p><p>The main things that Toshiba is keen to point out are the fact it has the fastest processor around, in the shape of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 1 GHz processor, and it''s also among the thinnest at under a centimetre. It''s running Windows Mobile 6.1, and all the signs point to a free upgrade when version 6.5 hits in a few months'' time.</p><p>But the first thing to note about this phone is the screen. Let''s not beat around the bush here; it''s massive at 4.1 inches. What''s more curious is that Toshiba decided not to stop there &ndash; there''s up to two centimetres more border around that screen to extend the phone to a frankly insane 129 x 70 x 9.9 mm chassis size.</p><p>In the hand, these dimensions just feel odd. It''s a phone that exceeds anything you''ll have felt before as the screen is the largest seen on a 3G phone. Where the screen extended to the edges of the phone, it could have been a lot more ergonomic, but as it stands, it just feels... very strange.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/toshibatg01review4-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba tg01 in the hand"></figure></p><p>But thankfully, the gigantic dimensions are somewhat balanced by the light 129g weight and 9.9mm depth, meaning it feels a lot lighter than it looks. It''s also (bizarrely) one of the most pocketable phones, as long as you have deep pockets, so perhaps the chassis size isn''t as much to worry about.</p><p>The button layout on the sides of the phone is a little weird, with the power and volume controls down the left hand edge and the camera and micro-USB socket (covered by a hard-to-close flap) on the right.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/toshibatg01review10-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba tg01 microusb"></figure></p><p>The front of the device, right at the bottom, features three touch sensitive offerings &ndash; the home and back buttons, and the touch sensitive bar that used for dragging up the Free Pad, in a similar way to the Palm Pre and its gesture zone, and for zooming in and out of web pages.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/toshibatg01review5-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba tg01 thin"></figure></p><p>The call and terminate buttons are placed on the touchscreen itself, as well as the softkey options too, and are slightly to small to press easily on the go, although if you stop and make you''re hitting the right place it''s no big deal.</p><p>The back of the TG01, featuring the 3.2MP camera without flash at the top, is made of matte plastic, which dare we say it, feels a little flimsy and doesn''t quite fits as snugly to the main chassis as we would have liked, with quite a bit of give.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/toshibatg01review2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba tg01"></figure></p><p>Overall, the lightness and size of the phone are the first things you notice when picking it up. The buttons are nicely flush to the chassis, and are easy-ish to find and press while still maintaining the minimalist design. It''s not going to be a phone to every customer''s taste, but at least Tosh, having come up with this design, has implemented it well.</p><p>Turning the phone on takes quite some time, especially the first time you switch it on. Apart from displaying a Toshiba logo, the TG01 appears to have frozen, and most people who buy it will probably go through a brief period of worry that they have broken it.</p><p>The screen, a WVGA resistive effort, is only reasonably responsive, although viewing anything on the screen is clear and pin sharp. Swiping through menus or tapping on a certain icon is a bit of a hit and miss experience however, and certainly not up there in the iPhone 3GS or  leagues.</p><p>At the top of the phone is an LED designed to let you know when the phone is low on battery (red), a call or text has arrived (blue) and when the phone is in sleep mode (green).</p><p>The latter is thoroughly annoying, winking away at you when the phone screen is off, and is rather reminiscent of a Simpsons scene when Homer invents an alarm that goes off in a cacophony every five minutes to let people know everything''s alright.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/toshibatg01review12-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba tg01 battery light"></figure></p><p>Thankfully, this can be turned off, where other phones (such as early N-Series Nokias) refused to let you do this, meaning you wanted to break them more and more as the contract wore on.</p><p>The power button allows the phone to be turned off (obviously) but also re-activates the screen when turned off and sleep mode is activated (which we can recognise thanks to the green flashing light). </p><p>However, for some inexplicable reason the length of time needed to press the power button to exit sleep mode can vary from less than a second to two or three, with no reason for the delay, which is a very annoying situation when you constantly want to check your phone.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/toshibatg01review11-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba tg01 power"></figure></p><p>We were a little bit confused by the processing speed and the way Toshiba has demonstrated it in the phone. When flipping the phone on its side, there''s a second or two''s wait until it re-orientates itself, and then the whole phone is available in landscape mode, which is pretty awesome.</p><p>But the question is: how often would you use a phone exclusively in landscape unless you were to buy a dock (and we''re not sure if they''re available) and connect up a keyboard, using it as a mini PC? It''s a well-executed touch though, and in fairness other screens twist round a lot quicker within phone, although nowhere near as fast as others (especially those from the range.)</p><p><strong>In the box</strong></p><p>Toshiba has provided a whole host of different bits and pieces in the box for the TG01, even including two CDs (Syncing software and User Guide).</p><p>There''s a microUSB charger and 3.5mm headphone adaptor, some instantly upgradeable headphones, and connection lead for the PC and a microUSB to USB adaptor.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/toshibatg01review19-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba tg01 in the box"></figure></p><p>Toshiba, despite claims it won''t be needed, has still popped a stylus in the box, and to help boost the TG01 claims of being a media phone, the UK version also gets an 8GB microSD card as well as a normal SD card converter to play said media on other devices too.</p> ', '', 'toshiba-tg01-4w500-420-90-160-80.jpg', 'toshibatg01review12-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'Toshiba is back with the TG01 - a phone that', 'Toshiba is back with the TG01 - a phone that it hopes will propel it to the forefront of the smartphone market, jostling the  and  out the way in the process.

And the reason for this is the 3.7-inch AMOLED screen and the HD camera stuck on the back, clearly screaming to the prospective customer: ''I like media and I don''t care who knows!''</p><p>And it''s certainly not one of these flimsy, plasticky, might-fall-apart-if-you-blow-on-it phones you see these days. No, we''re talking a solid metallic and plastic feel with a 148g weight to it... think somewhere between the Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 (3g lighter) and the T-Mobile G1 (10g heavier) and you''ll understand.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p6100212-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="The samsung i8190 hd"></figure></p><p>Something that should be noted from the outset is this chassis isn''t going to be to everyone''s taste; the size and weight mean it''s trouser friendly, but you''ll certainly know that it''s in there. Although if you''re like us and constantly panicking that you''ve lost your phone, it''s actually quite comforting.</p><p>But Samsung knows what it''s doing when making a mobile phone, and if this much technology has been packed into a 123 x 59 x 12.9 mm chassis, then it''s probably going to be pretty darn good.</p><p>The screen is simply to die for, as anyone that''s seen an OLED display in action can attest. Deep blacks, rich colours and pin sharp resolution really make every frame from this phone stand out, and it''s very easy just to spend time showing your friends just how beautiful your new handset'' screen is.</p><p>Slightly marring the waters is the fact that the screen, despite having all the usual OLED traits, is not much use in direct sunlight. It''s no worse than your usual LCD screen, but given its potential, we were hoping for a good <em>CSI </em>session in Regent''s Park, but ended up having to do it under a T-shirt, which probably made people assume we were looking at porn.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p6100214-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="The samsung i8190 hd"></figure></p><p>On the hardware side, the phone is well laid out with the Korean firm taking full advantage of the rare luxury of having swathes of chassis space to put buttons. The front three, decked out in chrome, handle the call, terminate and menu keys necessary for a Symbian S60 5th edition handset, and are large and easy to press.</p><p>The camera key is in the standard place, on the lower half of the left hand side, and has some nice give and solid feel for taking pictures and activating auto-focus. Above this is the lock key, which could do with being a little lower (as on the Tocco Ultra Edition) as it''s a little out of range for the average thumb.</p><p>On the top is something we internally cheer about whenever we see it, a 3.5mm headphone jack hidden by a little door to protect it when not in use. This cover is actually fairly difficult to lift, but helps keep the phone chassis sleek.</p><p>And on the right hand side, the up / down buttons and the microSD slot complete the look, with the keys feeling smooth and easy to press, and the memory card slot easy to open and pleasing to snap shut.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p6100242-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="The samsung i8190 hd"></figure></p><p><strong>In the box</strong></p><p>There''s a good set of kit in the box with the Samsung i8910 HD, with a charger, USB cable, stereo ear buds, installation CD, and what we initially thought was a screen cleaner, but turned out to be a great keyring-attachable stand, allowing you to use the phone as a standalone PMP player.</p><p>The stereo headphones are the standard (very decent) fare we''ve come to expect with from Samsung phones, but this set was sadly a one-piece item, without the headphone extender we''re used to. Admittedly, the two piece set was because previous phones didn''t have a 3.5mm headphone slot, and we probably were hoping for a bit much to believe Samsung would give us a handsfree set to use our own headphone with. It still would have been nice to have a clip on it though, to hold the microphone in place.</p><p>As mentioned, the screen stand is a brilliant surprise and really works, while the rest of the bits and pieces are of good quality, as we''ve come to expect from Samsung.</p> ', '', 'samsungi8910hd-160-80.jpg', 'p6100212-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'Samsung wants to be the number one mobile', 'Samsung wants to be the number one mobile manufacturer, and recent successes show it''s having a pretty good go.

In these credit-crunched times, though, sensibly it''s been busy, too, at the more cash-sensitive end of the mobile phone spectrum, with models like the S3500.</p>\n<p>The Samsung S3500 reworks that stylish slimline sliderphone template that proved so popular with the Ultra mobile series, delivering a handset with a serviceably sharp design, but priced at a more wallet-soothing price – starting at around £80 from launch on Virgin Mobile and Vodafone pre-pay deals, or free for contract customers.</p>\n<p>The features rundown of the S3500 is, of course, more modest than the recent headline-grabbing devices. The S3500 doesn''t do 3G or touch-control, but covers the mobile multimedia essentials with a music player, MicroSD card expansion slot, FM radio, and a 2-megapixel camera that also supports video-shooting.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong></p>\n<p>Its functionality may be more solid than pulse-racing, but the S3500 is tidily equipped on the design front. Its silver slider profile allows room for a reasonably sized 2.2-inch screen, a bright and clear 16-million colour QVGA (240x320 pixels) display.</p>\n<p>Under this is a conventional set of Samsung control buttonry on a classy smooth brushed metal control panel, and a large central 4-way navigation control pad. An assortment of softkeys offer quick access to a shortcut menu and phonebook functions, plus there are regular call and end buttons. As usual, there is a selection of user-definable shortcuts accessible from the navigation pad.</p>\n<p>More out of the ordinary, however, is that one of the shortcuts is designated for Fake Call – press it a couple of times and you can get an incoming call alert you can answer.</p>\n<p>You can even chat to a self-made recording, so you can pretend you''re taking a call. The idea is that it may get you out of tricky conversations, meetings, embarrassing situations, and so on – though it could be more embarrassing if someone catches you out.</p>\n<p>The menu system is regulation Samsung, with a main icon-based grid set-up, and subsequent numbered lists of sub-menu options. Straightforward to operate, with the slider down you can also select options by pressing a number rather than scrolling.</p>\n<p>The slider action is well executed – smooth but solid - and the numberpad is sensibly spaced. Curved rows and raised row spacing trim separate the keys enough, and although flush on a single panel, they feel adequately responsive for texting.</p>\n<p>At an all in weight of 95g and measuring 100(h) x 48(w) x 13.9(d)mm, it''s well balanced too with the slider open or shut, and slim enough to be unobtrusive in your pocket.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<p>There''s a reasonable set of features to play with. The music player is familiar Samsung software, organising tracks into regular category types in a presentable user interface that''s straightforward to operate via the navigation pad. It can sync with a PC, using the supplied USB cable and Samsung PC Studio CD software, or you can drag and drop into the phone or a memory card.</p>\n<p>The phone has around 45MB of user memory, though you can slot in MicroSD card up to 8GB (none is supplied in-box). You can transfer tracks and other files by Bluetooth too.</p>\n<p>Bluetooth stereo headphones can be used as an alternative to the in-box earphones, which are an average quality set with handsfree capability. You wouldn''t expect a phone like this to have a standard 3.5mm headphone socket, and the S3500 doesn''t surprise, with Samsung''s multi-connector slot on the side taking care of business for charger, USB and earphones.</p>\n<p>The audio performance is reasonable enough for this grade of handset, though through the supplied headset tunes sounds brighter than we''d prefer, and lower frequencies are subdued. It does the job, however, for casual listening as you go along. An easy to set up and use FM radio adds to the audio entertainment options.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera action</strong></p>\n<p>By Samsung''s own megapixel-stretching shooting standards, the camera on the S3500 is a low-key effort. A 2-megapixel snapper is minimum entry-level nowadays for all but the most basic of cameraphones.</p>\n<p>The camera is tucked away at the back under the slider, so you need to extend the phone to take pics. The user interface is tidily implemented though for this type of shooter; a press of the side camera button slips the screen sideways into viewfinder mode, and there''s a decent selection of typical cameraphone settings controls and effects to tweak original auto settings.</p>\n<p>There''s no autofocus or flash on the shooter, and the detail you can get in shots is limited. Within its limitations, it''s fine for easy snapping; colours look OK in good light conditions, and the auto metering system exposes shots well. Low light snapping isn''t much cop, however, as you might expect without added illumination – but this isn''t one of Samsung''s higher grade cameraphones.</p>\n<p>Video capture is supported, too, though recording at maximum QVGA quality (320 x 240 pixels) at up to 15 frames per second, results are average low quality mobile fare.</p>\n<p>Without high-speed 3G data connectivity, the browsing experience isn''t quite as nippy as more high-spec Samsung handsets. The NetFront v3.4 browser does, however, do a decent enough job at resolving pages effectively. The interface is a pretty ordinary mid-tier mobile affair – lists of options rather than onscreen tools – but you can view regular sites on the phone (albeit without Flash content).</p>\n<p>A regular bag of tools and organiser apps are present – including calendar, memo and task functions, world clock, calculator, convertor, voice recorder, timer, and stopwatch. Email is supported too. Samsung has also included a couple of games, Sudoku and JumpBoy, plus a bunch of trial games users can test out and buy.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>\n<p>Producing a solid, reliable voice calling performance, the S3500 fits the bill as an affordable phone that does the basics well. Power handling appeared to be sound too; Samsung claims optimum figures of up to 4 hours talktime or up to 400 hours standby, and with our typical usage we found no problems getting three days out of it between charging.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>In these cash-strapped times, there''s plenty of demand for phones that look smart and do the basics well, but don''t cost a fortune, and the Samsung S3500 ticks the right boxes for this type of handset. Its limited features rundown may not exactly excite gadget-lust, but what it does do it does in an unostentatious but effective way.

How else to explain the company''s lastest wheeze called the AURA – a style-led, low-spec handset costing over a grand?</p>\n<p>Who can afford one of those these days? Well, credit where it''s due, it''s undeniably a good-looking phone, with its hand-etched stainless steel casing and unusual swivel action (last seen on Motorola''s V70 back in 2002), albeit with the kind of spec that wouldn''t look out of place on an entry-level kids'' phone, with no 3G or Wi-Fi, no push email or smart phone accoutrements, and just a 2-megapixel camera.</p>\n<p><strong>Low tech, high fashion</strong></p>\n<p>Motorola claims the AURA''s look is inspired by classic watches, and perhaps it hopes that it will be considered in the same way as those Patek Phillippe ads where the exceptionally well-heeled father passes on his prized analogue chronograph to his son. It certainly seems built to last.</p>\n<p>The casework is solid and the swivel action is controlled by a complex series of precision-engineered cogs and bearings, which can be seen through a viewing port on the back of the handset. It feels like a quality device, and in this context, its possible that its lack of the latest hi-tech features could work to its advantage, since it''s unlikely to date quickly.</p>\n<p>A gentle push to the left activates the smooth swivel action and reveals an aluminium keypad modelled on the flat, metallic style of the RAZR series, with clearly spaced buttons but a small and rather fiddly four-way D-pad flanked by OK and back buttons.</p>\n<p><strong>Circular screen</strong></p>\n<p>The jewel in the AURA''s crown however is its unique circular screen. It features 16 million colours, 480-pixel diameter and sits beneath a grade 1,62-carat sapphire crystal lens which Motorola says is exceptionally scratch-resistant. It looks gorgeous, with pin-sharp detail going all the way to the edge of the elliptical lens.</p>\n<p>Pictures look great on the AURA''s screen, so it''s a pity that the onboard camera is so low grade. It''s a basic 2 megapixel model with no dedicated shutter button (you''ll need to dig into the menu to find it), no autofocus and no flash, though there is a 4x digital zoom.</p>\n<p>Maximum picture resolution is 1600x1200 pixels but the screen''s quality magnifies flaws and pics are prone to grain, even in goodish light. Video is even less attractive, with a resolution dropping to a modest 176x144 pixels and blurring very easily with movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Media options</strong></p>\n<p>The music player fares better, though it too is a basic model. It plays all the usual formats, including AAC, AAC+, e-AAC+, MIDI, MP3, WAV and WMA. There''s 2GB of memory onboard to accommodate your tunes and pics, but if that''s not enough you''re stuck, since there''s no memory card option.</p>\n<p>The supplied headphones aren''t bad, offering a better than usual level of clean, clear bass. This is just as well, since there''s no 3.5mm jack plug which would allow you to use another pair (though there is an adaptor which allows you to convert Motorola''s power slot to mini USB). Or you could add wireless headphones using the stereo Bluetooth connection.</p>\n<p>Among the paltry extras are a few basic games (though you can add more Java time-wasters via the WAP internet connection), voice recorder, alarm clock and calculator – not much in other words.</p>\n<p>The battery stood up fairly well however, giving us a good three days of moderate use (not that there was very much to use it on). The next few months will tell if the AURA is a flyer or a failure. A decent camera would have really helped take advantage of that gorgeous screen and that keypad could have been a bit easier to use.</p>\n<p>But compared to other super-expensive phones with low spec counts such as the Vertu or Nokia''s 8800 series, the AURA stands tall in the style department – its distinctive look and unique screen easily put it in front of the competition.</p>', '', 'aura20by20motorola20left-done-160-80.jpg', 'motorola-aura-1.jpg', NULL, '"Recession?

But can its purpose-built credentials amount to the first bona fide touchscreen challenger to the Apple'' device? Possibly.</p>\n<p><strong>''ClickThrough'' touchscreen</strong></p>\n<p>RIM has traditionally held a rather dim view on touchscreen mobiles. It''s no surprise, then, that the company''s first outing into the world of touchy-feely handsets holds something completely different in store – a fully ''clickable'' screen.</p>\n<p>In effect, the whopping 3.25in screen is actually one giant button enabling users to genuinely feel the screen move downwards when an icon or key is pressed. Put your finger gently on one of the tiled menu icons and it will flash blue, with a pop-up letting you know what action the key controls; press down fully and you activate the function.</p>\n<p>When it comes to tapping out emails and texts, the Storm attempts to be all things to all men. Hold the handset in portrait mode and you''re presented with RIM''s compressed SureType keypad layout – or, if you prefer, switch to old-school Multitap input; flip to landscape and the layout automatically switches to full QWERTY courtesy of an accelerometer.</p>\n<p>The full keypad is fairly sizable, which limits the amount of message text you can see – but you can''t have your QWERTY cake and eat it. Unlike the iPhone, it does support copy and paste. Just click the beginning and end points of the text, press the Menu key and select Copy and repeat for Paste. Easy.</p>\n<p>So, with a touchscreen handset living and dying by its finger-friendliness, how does the Storm measure up? Like anything, it''s a case of getting used to it. Spend a bit of quality time with the Storm and you''ll soon eradicate those emails that display the same grasp of spelling as your four-year-old nephew. But many – especially the less dextrous – will find there''s no substitute for old-fashioned buttons.</p>\n<p>Responsiveness can also be a big issue, with the menu overly sluggish at times. More infuriating is the slowness of the accelerometer, and although the angle at which it is activated can be adjusted, the speed of response remains unchanged – a major hindrance to the handset''s ease of use.</p>\n<p><strong>Communication king</strong></p>\n<p>RIM may have given the Storm an alluring facelift, but communication is still at its core. Email is – as you would expect – dealt with adeptly. In addition to the usual outstanding Enterprise functionality it''s now even easier for the less business-inclined to set up personal accounts simply by entering a username and password. Inboxes can be kept separate, with push email instantly alerting you to new messages in each account.</p>\n<p>Document viewing and editing is seamless using DataViz''s Documents To Go, so email attachments can be dealt with fluidly. There''s also RIM''s usual set of calendar and address book functions, which can be synced to your PC using the accompanying BlackBerry Desktop Software.</p>\n<p><strong>BlackBerry Application Centre</strong></p>\n<p>But RIM is determined to prove the Storm isn''t just for suits, and the inclusion of a raft of Instant Messaging apps for download as well as a Facebook and Flickr apps will add to its zeitgeist appeal. All of these are available to download free from the Vodafone-hosted Application Centre, which also offers apps like YouTube and Google Maps. These will be joined by many more next year when RIM launches its own Application Storefront in March.</p>\n<p><strong>Multimedia features</strong></p>\n<p>The Storm''s social networking apps are well integrated into the furniture of the handset. Once downloaded, you can upload your photos to Flickr or videos to YouTube at the click of a button. Geo-tagging is a notable absentee, despite the inclusion of GPS. As a nod to its business roots, companies will still have the ability to control what apps its employees download.</p>\n<p>The camera itself is a capable 3.2-megapixel number offering auto focus, zoom and auto flash (well, LED light). There''s a small lag between focus and taking a picture, but images are still reasonably crisp – not quite up to Sony Ericsson''s Cyber-shot or Carl Zeiss imbued Nokias, but more than acceptable for the likes of Flickr and co.</p>\n<p>The music player keeps things clean and functional but still supports cover art and the ability to create playlists on the device itself. The built-in speaker is surprisingly rich, and audio quality in general is above par. A 3.5mm jack is provided to connect your own headphones, and side buttons (real ones) act as volume controls.</p>\n<p>Supported formats are extensive and include MP3, AAC and WMA. There''s also iTunes ''syncing'' with your PC, although not quite in the way your iPod does it. Essentially the BlackBerry Media Sync software allows you to see and import your iTunes library – but will not copy over any tracks downloaded from the iTunes Store due to that harbinger of doom, DRM.</p>\n<p>Watching movies on the vivid 3.25in screen is also enjoyable. Fortunately storage isn''t an issue either, with 1GB of onboard memory supplemented by an expansion slot supporting microSD/SDHC cards up to 16GB.</p>\n<p><strong>Wi-Fi missing from the party</strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to connectivity, there''s good news and bad news. The good news first: HSDPA is included for faster mobile browsing, while USB and stereo Bluetooth are both present and correct. You can even use the handset as a tethered modem. The bad news is there''s no Wi-Fi.</p>\n<p>It''s debatable as to how big a deal this is – for many though it could be a deal breaker. In reality, Vodafone has implemented a variety of ''all-you-can-eat'' style internet and email tariffs, removing the worry of humungous mobile bills at the end of the month. Which just leaves the issue of speed. With no Wi-Fi you''re at the mercy of Vodafone''s 3G and HSDPA coverage, and while one of the best around in this respect, nobody''s perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>True rival or pretender to the crown?</strong></p>\n<p>Whether the Storm has done enough to topple the iPhone is very much in the balance. Performance is excellent: voice calls are clear, email is handled seamlessly and battery life is good for a push email HSDPA device. Add to that the potential of the upcoming Application Storefront and generally swish looks, and things appear rosy for RIM.</p>\n<p>The real question is whether the innovative ClickThrough touchscreen will be welcomed with willing fingers, and whether issues over menu responsiveness and the accelerometer are dealt with swiftly. If not, frustration will win out, and the Storm may well blow over.</p>\n<p><strong>Looks: 8/10<br />\nEase of use: 7/10<br />\nFeatures: 8/10<br />\nCall quality: 10/10<br />\nValue: 7/10</strong></p>', '', 'img54501blackberry9500wb-800-160-80.jpg', 'blackberry7.jpg', NULL, 'Rumour has it that the BlackBerry Storm', 'Rumour has it that the BlackBerry Storm concept was first spawned after Vodafone lost out to O2 in the iPhone bragging rights.

(45, 'Sony Ericsson W715 review', 'sony-ericsson-w715-review', 'Don Miller', 'Techradar', 'Sony Ericsson''s classy looking W715 packs in A-GPS location technology, Wi-Fi and a cracking Walkman player performance', '&#160;', '<p>While we admired the design, ample mid-range features and delightful Walkman music player of the , the near-identical looking W715 adds an extra bit of must-have high-tech spec to zoom in on: A-GPS satellite location finding.</p>\n<p>Available in the UK exclusively through Vodafone, the Sony Ericsson W715 can be thought of pretty much as a super-charged Sat Nav-packing version of the W705.</p>\n<p>Its form sheet lists an enticing set of features for a non-smartphone device: Wi-Fi and HSPA 3G high-speed connectivity, the latest Walkman software (including Shake Control), with a 4GB Memory Stick Micro card packaged in-box, video calling, plus support for a variety of online services. A 3.2-megapixel camera with flash is also built in.</p>\n<p><strong>Design </strong></p>\n<p>Features aside, the W715 is an elegantly attractive sliderphone. It has many of the stylish design hallmarks of the  candybar classic, including a brushed aluminium front panel with angular edges, a rubber-feel back panel, and fine finishing touches. The silver fascia with its low-key gold trim and well-contoured circular control pad arrangement is a sharp-looker as well as a joy to operate.</p>\n<p>A large-ish 2.4-inch, QVGA 262k-colour display is a bright and clear platform for showing off its multimedia wares, while the slider mechanism is solidly built but smooth-running. The one-piece surface of the numberpad is subtly bumped and marked to help fingers work the spacious keys accurately. It also has a nice, springy action for responsive texting and number punching.</p>\n<p>As far as Walkman buttons are concerned, the central navigation D-pad, which is the hub of the menu control system, takes care of music business too, with music controls marked on it. A satellite icon on the D-pad also provides hotkey access to the various location-based services.</p>\n<p>Another Walkman control button sits inconspicuously on top of the phone. This very tiny key fires up the music player, and when tunes are playing can also be utilised for working the Walkman''s Shake Control gadgetry. Press and hold while shaking in certain directions and you can switch tracks back and forward, increase and lower volume, or shuffle track playback.</p>\n<p>The button''s positioning makes it a touch awkward to hold and shake, though it does work adequately. But, as you still need to press a button to use Shake Control, it''s just as simple, and less fiddly, just to press the forward/rewind or volume buttons instead (unless you have the music player operating in the background, in which case you can save yourself one whole button press using shake operation).</p>\n<p>The motion sensor accelerometer that underpins Shake Control is also used to auto-rotate screen orientation between portrait and landscape in certain media and browser functions, depending how the user is holding the phone.</p>\n<p><strong>Handling </strong></p>\n<p>Measuring 95(h) x 48(w) x 14.3(d) mm and weighing a reasonable 98g, it''s a pocket-friendly size and feels good in-hand. The menu system is mostly typical mid-range Sony Ericsson, with the navigation pad being used to negotiate most elements of the grid-based main menu, sub menu lists and tabbed sets of options.</p>\n<p>The controls are fairly conventional, with shortcuts onthe D–pad, softkeys under the screen, plus a familiar Sony Ericsson Activity Menu button propelling you into a handy menu of useful functions, mobile internet browser and info options. Here you can switch on or off Wi-Fi, activate Bluetooth, kick off pre-loaded apps, or operate the browser with just a quick bit of scroll and select action. Easy.</p>\n<p>In the Vodafone-optimised version of the handset, Sony Ericsson''s usual set-up has been given a mild makeover. A link to the Vodafone live! portal are one of on the softkey options on the standby screen, menus are appropriately themed, and options for Vodafone services are integrated into the control system and options – so you get Vodafone Music in the Walkman player options, a Vodafone live!-based browser home screen, Vodafone Messenger instant messaging, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Sat-nav software</strong></p>\n<p>Vodafone has also included its Find &amp; Go route planning and search software among the Location Services folder, utilizing the A-GPS satellite software to good effect. In addition, as well as the fine Google Maps location spotting, mapping, search and route-planning software we''ve come to expect on mid-range Sony Ericssons, Find &amp; Go offers route planning and search facilities for businesses, services, addresses and other points of interest, plus the option to upgrade to a Sat Nav solution with turn-by-turn voice instructions and onscreen 2D and 3D street map guidance. This upgrade is free for three months, after which it costs a £4.89 per month subscription.</p>\n<p>While this is similar to a standalone Sat Nav set-up, it''s not as sophisticated and maps are updated over the air as you go along rather than being stored onboard the phone or memory card. It works well enough though and is quick to refresh via HSPA mobile data connections.</p>\n<p>Of course, it''s not a replacement for a large-display, dedicated in-car Sat Nav system, but the A-GPS hardware on the W715 is effective, and tracks changing positions quickly and accurately. It offers a potentially very useful tool for finding your way around in unfamiliar places – particularly as you''re always likely to have your mobile close to hand. It could well be the feature that sways some potential W705 buyers to reach for the Vodafone-exclusive W715 instead.</p>\n<p>A-GPS is also employed for Sony Ericsson''s Tracker app, running performance software which can record work outs, calculate calories burned, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Walkman phone</strong></p>\n<p>We expect Walkman-branded phones to put in a top of the bill music performance, and the W715 delivers with an excellent audio performance from its music software. The music player interface is the usual attractive and intuitive mid-range Walkman set-up, smoothly taking you through various music categories options under which tracks are listed.</p>\n<p>These include the usual albums, tracks, artists, playlists, genres, plus year, podcasts and audio books. Sony Ericsson''s SensMe option – where tunes can be selected according to pre-defined mood and tempo – is listed too. To use this option these criteria have to be defined before copying over from a PC using supplied Media Manager software. Tracks can also be dragged and dropped in mass storage mode with the USB cable attached, or Bluetoothed over.</p>\n<p>Another category included is the Vodafone Music service, from which you can buy tracks individually or subscribe to it Music Unlimited downloads.</p>\n<p>The Walkman player''s sound quality through the decent quality in-ear headset supplied is top quality for a mobile phone, with a lovely dynamic sound, good depth, and sufficient bass whack where required. <br />\nAlthough there''s no standard 3.5mm headphone socket on the phone itself (annoyingly there''s the usual Sony Ericsson chunky multi-connector on the side again), an adapter is supplied as part of the two-piece headset, in case you want to add your own ear-gear. Stereo Bluetooth wireless earphones are supported too.</p>\n<p>With a 4GB card in-box to supplement the 120MB of onboard storage, you can get a fair few tracks on before having to buy another Memory Stick Micro. An FM radio is included in the W715''s spec too, for a bit of extra audio entertainment.</p>\n<p><strong>Wi-Fi connection</strong></p>\n<p>The Wi-Fi connectivity really adds speed to your browsing, downloading and uploading when in range of a suitable Wi-Fi connection. It''s simple to use and maintain connections automatically on access points you regularly use.</p>\n<p>Mobile network connectivity is pretty brisk too; the phone''s HSPA can provide downloads at up to 7.2Mbps rates, plus faster 3G uploads where supported on the network. This works effectively when uploading images or video clips to blogging or content sharing sites; the W715 is pre-loaded with fast links to Blogger, Picasa Web Album and MySpace online accounts, and users can easily define their own for other services.</p>\n<p>The camera isn''t the snappiest of snappers, however. It''s a middle-of-the-road fixed focus 3.2-megapixel shooter, with no autofocus to get precise focusing on subjects, and has an average set of mid-tier settings adjustments and effects rather than anything more Cyber-shot phone-like. Its average quality pictures are OK in strong light, though they can lack detail look a touch soft when lighting deteriorates. The LED flash isn''t particularly strong and, other than very close up images, shots taken in the dark aren''t adequately lit.</p>\n<p><strong>Video capture</strong></p>\n<p>Video capture is no great shakes either, recording at up to 15 frames per second in QVGA resolution for distinctly average quality footage.</p>\n<p>Sony Ericsson does provide the usual combination of useful tools, handy apps and bits of time-killing fun. Organiser functionality includes calendar, tasks, notes, timer, stopwatch, voice recorder, calculator, and a code memo app. In addition email and instant messaging are supported, while among other gadgetry there''s a Walk Mate pedometer feature as a more sedate alternative to the Tracker GPS running feature, TrackID song identification software, a Music Quiz app, and a selection of demo Java games.</p>\n<p>Call quality is certainly up to scratch on this handset, with excellent call reception and audio performance. Best scenario battery life is reckoned by Sony Ericsson to be up to 350 hours of standby time on 3G networks (400 hours in GSM coverage), or 4 hours of talktime (10 hours on GSM). Be aware that heavy usage of the more power hungry features will eat into real-life battery life. We managed just over two days of charge with moderate use of Wi-Fi and A-GPS, plus a normal amount of calling and other Walkman-related use.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Including many elements of other higher end Walkman phones, this is one of the most attractive of Sony Ericsson''s music majoring bunch. Sure, its camera is a weak spot, and while it doesn''t break radically new ground for the music phone brand, it has some well-integrated higher-end features like Wi-Fi and A-GPS, a top-drawer Walkman music player experience and a classy design. A fine mid-range addition to the line-up.</p>', '', 'w715frontdone-160-80.jpg', 'w705-w715-pl.jpg', NULL, 'While we admired the design, ample mid-range', 'While we admired the design, ample mid-range features and delightful Walkman music player of the , the near-identical looking W715 adds an extra bit of must-have high-tech spec to zoom in on:', '28/07/2014', 1, 3),

As well as a bunch of new models announced recently, Vodafone has given its ultra low-cost models a Catwalk Collection refresh.</p>\n<p>The new-look Vodafone 527 is one of these, a budget candybar phone that has been made over for value-conscious phone buyers who still desire a bit of show.</p>\n<p>The recession-beating 527 Catwalk Collection phone is now available in a range of eye-grabbingly colourful bodywork choices - violet, ice (white), rose (pink), lemon and sky (blue).</p>\n<p>As you might expect when it''s selling at a mere £20 in a Vodafone Pay as you Talk package, the 527 is not exactly stuffed to the gills with high-tech gadgetry. It''s a workmanlike dual-band GSM handset rather than a 3G model. But it does have a few features to entertain away the downturn, including a music player with MicroSD memory card expansion, FM radio, and camera - albeit a rudimentary VGA snapper.</p>\n<p><strong>Stylish design</strong></p>\n<p>Like a number of its own-branded handsets, Vodafone has sourced the 527 from French handset manufacturer Sagem. Its candybar design looks and feels smooth and quite thin, measuring 107(h) x 47(w) x 11.8(d)mm, and at 80g is reasonably weighted.</p>\n<p>It''s curved around the edges, and the strikingly-coloured casings have a subtle dimpling design touch on the back that also makes for firm handling. A smattering of chrome trim is around the edges and on the fascia adds another nice touch.</p>\n<p>The glossy black front panel and numberpad arrangement is a bit plasticky and squeaky, but is adequate for this sort of price. The control pad arrangement is conventional mobile stuff, with a central navigation D-pad flanked by normal softkeys and call and end buttons.</p>\n<p>The numberpad is OK for a basic phone, though the action does feel a bit heavy when texting, so speedier texters may not warm to it. Shortcut options on the D-pad offer quick access to functions in the usual way, and there''s a softkey designated for one-button Vodafone live! access. Above this, the display is a basic 1.8-inch, 65K-colour 128 x 160 pixels array.</p>\n<p>Menu navigation is straightforward, with a default grid of icons, plus sub-menu lists, some of which offer tabs to scroll between. It''s easy to find your way around, and few complications to confuse, even if it''s a fraction languid at responding.</p>\n<p><strong>Phone features</strong></p>\n<p>With 10MBs of onboard storage, the 527 requires an additional memory card to make its music player in any way useful. MicroSD cards up to 1GB capacity can slot in under the back panel, and can be swapped without taking out the battery pack.</p>\n<p>The MP3 player user interface is rudimentary and clunky to use, but it offers a few useful options, including creating playlists of tracks. The supplied earphones are better than average, and sound quality is reasonable at this price point.</p>\n<p>However, the music player may appeal more to younger buyers who want a few tracks to carry around with them rather than as a surrogate music player, as its limited user interface and file support are pretty low grade by modern phone standards.</p>\n<p>One out of the box useful entertainment tool is the onboard FM radio. Again, it''s not sophisticated as the modern phone norm, but it does the job adequately through the in-box-headset.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic video</strong></p>\n<p>Video shooting and playback isn''t supported on this handset, however, which may put off some buyers. Its camera is purely used for stills, snapping at a VGA (640x480) resolution – extremely basic for any cameraphone, even at entry-level prices. Image quality on this limited shooter is poor, though it''ll serve those looking for quick snap''n''send photo messages when quality isn''t an issue.</p>\n<p>Although back to basics in spec, the Vodafone 527 still serves up a selection of essential phone organiser functions and tools. A calendar with voice memo, and to do lists with voice record, calculator, alarm and timer functions are included. A selection of demo games come pre-loaded, which you can upgrade to full versions via Vodafone live!</p>\n<p>As the phone is customised for Vodafone live! you also have hotkey access to its downloads and information portal, plus services like Vodafone Mail and Messenger Email and Instant Messaging are available to use from the phone. An Openwave Wap browser, running on GPRS, also does the basics of mobile internet browsing.</p>\n<p><strong>Decent battery</strong></p>\n<p>With a limited amount of functionality to suck battery life, the Vodafone 527 Catwalk Collection model puts is a satisfactory power performance. From a full charge we managed around three days of normal usage; Vodafone quotes optimum figures of up to 220 hours of standby time or up to 3 hours of talktime.</p>\n<p>We might have expected more from a dual-band handset, but its real-life performance is adequate.<br />\nAlso, the while the 527 may take a minimalist line in features, it still manages to get the basics of voice calling right. It puts in a commendably clear sound performance with dependable call strength.</p>\n<p><strong>Budget option</strong></p>\n<p>The Vodafone 527 may have been spiced up a bit with its zingy Catwalk Collection paintjobs, and it''s a relatively attractive slimline budget phone, but this is still a modestly equipped handset, even by budget phone standards.</p>\n<p>It does have a few functions to keep users entertained, and it does the essentials efficiently. Austerity chic or not, its bargain basement price tag is still the main attraction of this particular handset.</p>', '', 'front-vodafone-527--combined-160-80.jpg', 'vodafone-527-pink-camera-h1.png', NULL, 'Touchscreen control, GPS, multi-megapixel', 'Touchscreen control, GPS, multi-megapixel cameras and other high-end gadgetry may be grabbing the glory at the moment, but in these cash-squeezed times there''s still plenty of demand for far more', '28/07/2014', 1, 3),
(47, 'T-Mobile G1 review', 't-mobile-g1-review', 'Don Miller', 'Techradar', 'The iPhone is still the champ. Yet, as they say in the Visa ads, for everything else, there''s the G1. It is a top mobile performer.', '&#160;', '<p>Let''s get this over with: the new T-Mobile G1 Google phone is no Apple iPhone killer. In case you were wondering, the iPhone has better applications (and a better app store), provides a more enjoyable entertainment experience for movies and music, and supports a true multitouch screen with gesture controls.</p>\n<p>But that''s nowhere near the whole story. There''s still an awful lot of reasons to get excited about the G1. In fact, we''d say it is easily in the top-five of all mobile phones ever made and showcases why Google Android was worth the long wait. A truly ''open'' device, the G1 is locked as a T-Mobile device only for three months, after which you can use any service.</p>\n<p>The G1 is available for free on T-Mobile Combi and Flext price plans from £40 a month, including unlimited mobile internet, says the company. Combi 35 offers 800 minutes and unlimited texts while Flext 40 gives up to 1,250 minutes or up to 2,500 texts, or any mix of the two.</p>\n<p>Android Market, which is the most compelling feature on the phone, is also wide open: any developer can create any sort of app and make it available for all G1 users. (Apple is more restrictive about how they run their app store.) Overall, the G1 is a stellar phone and points to a future when a phone is as flexible and useful as the PC on your desk.</p>\n<p><strong>Out-of-the-box experience</strong></p>\n<p>Like the Sidekick phones from T-Mobile, the G1 will impress right out of the box. It comes with a standard pair of headphones. (Sadly, they use a proprietary HTC connection called ExtUSB, but you can get an adapter to use regular headphones.) The device feels slightly hefty at 158g, but it also seems more durable than some phones, especially the recently released HTC Touch Pro.</p>\n<p>There''s a slide-out QWERTY keyboard that is functional and sturdy, but too small unless you have dainty fingers. We actually prefer typing on the soft keyboard of the iPhone, surprisingly enough. Yet, typing on the G1''s slide-out means you can see your email, web browser, and any other app in full-screen mode.</p>\n<p>The G1''s 3.2-inch TFT-LCD display runs in 320x480 resolution - a hair smaller than the 3.5-inch 480x320 resolution screen on the iPhone. At first glance, the G1 looks crisp and bright, but in a side-by-side comparison to the iPhone, it''s obvious that the G1 screen is not really meant for watching movies - it''s just slightly too small and the colour contrast doesn''t pop that much. No matter: it is intended as a powerful application-centric phone for business use and for entertainment.</p>\n<p>On further inspection, you''ll find the G1 has a menu button, a home button, and a back button. To place a call, you click the phone icon and dial a number, or choose one of your contacts (thankfully imported automatically from your Gmail account). There are volume controls on the side and a camera button.</p>\n<p>There''s also a very small trackball that you may rarely - if ever - use. The G1 supports HSDPA for high-speed browsing and email, among other things. Voice calls sounded crisp and clear, a testament to the fact that HTC has figured out how to make smartphones, and that T-Mobile generally sounds clear.<br />\nStandard specs, for a smartphone</p>\n<p>The G1 has built-in GPS, Bluetooth 2.0, 802.11b/g Wi-Fi, a 3.2 megapixel camera, a microSD expansion slot that''s SD 2.0 compatible, and 256MB of internal storage. Okay, those are becoming fairly standard specs for a next-gen smartphone, but let''s cover them in detail anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Exceptional mapping</strong></p>\n<p>The GPS chip works exceptionally well with Google Maps, finding my location easily. Strangely, GPS is disabled by default and the G1 uses cell phone triangulation out-of-the-box. We figure this is to save battery life, and perhaps because not every user is interested in using GPS mapping. (We''ll explain more about how Android apps are using the GPS chip in a bit.)</p>\n<p>While Bluetooth support is great for swapping files with your PC, the G1 does not support AD2P - so no stereo Bluetooth for your MP3s. We had great success using the built-in Wi-Fi at home, at Starbucks and at an airport over a public hotspot, flying along (ahem) on the built-in browser and downloading MP3 files from the Amazon store - which you can only do over Wi-Fi, not over the carrier service.</p>\n<p>The built-in camera, like the one in the iPhone, is passable - it doesn''t let you set white balance or aperture priority, it''s just a point-and-click. Images looked okay - grainy and washed out, but we weren''t expecting Canon quality. It was great to take a series of photos and save them on my 2GB Kingston microSD card for an entire week of photo-happy snapshots, knowing they are all saved on my mobile device. As you can guess, using up the 256MB of internal storage might take you a single day.</p>\n<p><strong>So what about Android?</strong></p>\n<p>So the G1 is a great hardware device, but what about the operating system? Glad you asked: it''s absolutely amazing. In some ways, the G1''s standard hardware features pale in comparison to the Android software.</p>\n<p>Google has outdone themselves: the browser runs fast, there''s an easy-to-find search field, contact manager, and a scheduler. None of these tools are going to revolutionise the smartphone industry, and my one major complaint about the G1 is that they don''t actually support a true multitouch device.</p>\n<p>Sure, in Gmail, you can flick up and down with your finger, and in the browser you can flick around the screen like it''s a piece of paper. I like how, on the main home screen in Android, you can flick to the left and right to see more of your screen. To drop apps onto those areas of the screen, you click menu, find the one you want, click with your finger and hold down, then drag it to the home screen.</p>\n<p>Fine. But the G1 doesn''t actually support gestures where you can point fingers together or apart to zoom in, tap the screen, or perform other basic iPhone-like manoeuvres. We''re not sure if this is due to patent restrictions or because the touchscreen doesn''t support them. We''d put the multitouch controls somewhere between the HTC Touch Pro (very limited) and the iPhone (very useful). This makes the built-in apps a little less compelling, because they are more static and standard.</p>\n<p>We do like the Android Market idea, although the iPhone app store has a much better selection. We downloaded Pac Man, a task switcher, a program for reading barcodes (using the built-in camera), and one that just shows a blob on the screen - a sort of Tamagotchi for mobile users. None of these tools are outstanding, but Google promises that developers will just go nuts with cool applets, so we''ll see.</p>\n<p>We did like the MP3 download utility, which uses Amazon. The songs downloaded quickly over Wi-Fi and played at an acceptable bit rate (but, again, do not compare to the iPhone or iPod). There is a YouTube app that worked flawlessly.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>There''s more to say about the G1. In the future, we''d imagine developers will really tap into the power of GPS for location-aware services (say, finding a bus that is near your current location). T-Mobile and others have planned some accessories that include carrying pouches and extra headsets.</p>\n<p>We didn''t even mention that the G1 is a standalone phone - it does not sync contacts or schedules with your PC or Mac, and it doesn''t even include any desktop software (in your face, Microsoft).</p>\n<p>But let''s be clear about this: the G1 would have taken over the world in 2005. It is an outstanding phone, and Android is highly extensible, intuitive to use, fast, and very powerful. We''re not going to rank mobile operating systems, but let''s just say that RIM, Nokia, Palm, and Microsoft should all be really nervous right about now.</p>\n<p>And here''s the final assessment: we''d buy the G1 if the iPhone didn''t already exist and we''d certainly be first in line if our chosen carrier was T-Mobile. If you really need to type fast, okay - Blackberry models have the G1 phone beat in terms of hardware keyboards. The iPhone is still the champ. Yet, as they say in the Visa ads, for everything else, there''s the G1. It is a top mobile performer.</p>', '', 't-mobile-g1-1-160-80.jpg', 'g1-blk-0.jpg', NULL, 'Let''s get this over with: the new T-Mobile G1', 'Let''s get this over with: the new T-Mobile G1 Google phone is no Apple iPhone killer.

The extra 3g weight isn''t a problem, but while the slimmer dimensions certainly make it more pocket-friendly, the smaller screen might be an issue for video buffs.</p>\n<p>However, there are compensations, since this screen is a first for Nokia, using OLED technology (rather than the usual LCD) and it shows, in the brightness, sharpness and detail of games and videos, though the improvement is barely noticeable when scrolling through the menus. The 16 million colours of the 320x240-pixel screen don''t hurt either.</p>\n<p><strong>Slender sliderphone</strong></p>\n<p>It may not have the full 16GB internal storage of the N96 but it comes with an 8GB memory card in box.</p>\n<p>Around the sides are a microSD slot (up to 16GB cards are supported), volume rocker, camera shutter and screen lock buttons, plus twin speakers on one side, which switches to top when you''re watching video in landscape mode, with power on button, micro USB slot and 3.5mm headphone jack on top. Around the back is the 5 megapixel camera lens usefully covered by a slide next to dual LED flash lights.</p>\n<p>Nokia has dispensed with the dedicated power port – you power up through the micro USB port, which saves space on the casing, and you can even do without the power cord since it will charge through your PC.</p>\n<p>Like the N96, the slide operates in two directions – one way reveals the slightly cramped, smooth keypad, the other unveils media player controls for watching video or playing music.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful camera</strong></p>\n<p>The 5 megapixel camera engages automatically when you flip open the shutter covering the Carl Zeiss lens (just stiff enough to prevent accidental opening and there''s no danger of breaking any nails).</p>\n<p>It takes about four seconds to open, but once roused snaps are very quick and it''s got loads of features, including autofocus, burst mode, 20x digital zoom and geotagging, plus the Nseries'' impressive post-pic editing suite.</p>\n<p>Pics are of more than passable quality (maximum resolution 2592x1944), with convincing colour tones and impressive depth. The double LED flash is okay, but as usual, not quite up to what you''d expect from the proper xenon variety.

A functional, straight-down-the-line phone that''s easy on the wallet is no bad thing. And if it''s easy on the eye, too, that''s even better.</p>\n<p>At the budget end of its own-brand phone range, Vodafone has been getting busy, with several new models announced at Mobile World Congress. These include a Catwalk Collection makeover for its value 533 sliderphone. Produced by French mobile maker Sagem, the revamped Vodafone 533 ditches drabness for a selection of bright and breezy colours, including gold, candy (pink), ice (white), violet, and petrol (blue).</p>\n<p>Cheap and cheerful is the order of the day. The 533 is pitched at a recession-dodging £30 on Vodafone pre-pay. At that basement price, the features list is unsurprisingly modest – it''s a tri-band GSM handset, without 3G connectivity, but it does have a 1.3-megapixel camera with video shooting option, a music player, FM radio, and MicroSD memory card support.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong></p>\n<p>Vodafone offers good value on the design front for the budget-squeezed. The 533 has a serviceable, curved edge sliderphone construction that feels solid enough in-hand. Its casing is plastic and it has a one-piece slider numberpad, but it feels smooth and the control panel around the navigation D-pad is tidily designed, with bits of chrome trim worked in.</p>\n<p>The Catwalk Collection may not be destined for supermodel handbags, but we can see the eye-catching paintjobs appealing particularly to younger cash-strapped mobile buyers. On the back too, a bit of individual patterning prettifies them further.</p>\n<p>The phone measures a pocket-friendly 97(h) x 46(w) x 13.7(d)mm, weighing a reasonable 90g. Its display is a 2-inch 256k-colour, 176x220 pixels TFT, a bright screen, which is fine for this class of handset. The user interface is fairly conventional stuff, based initially around a grid of main menu option icons, and subsequent tabbed sub-menu lists as you drill in to the options. The graphics aren''t the most sophisticated, but they do the job, and the user interface is mostly no-nonsense and straightforward to operate. The D-pad offers the usual type of shortcut options, and there''s a typical softkey link to the Vodafone live! content portal.</p>\n<p>The basic controls are easy to operate although it can feel a tad pedestrian tapping your way through the menus. The one-piece keypad, which has numbers separated by ridges, is adequate for reasonable-paced texting.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<p>With just 8MB of internal memory, you''ll need to spend a little on a MicroSD card if you want to give it a go as a music player. The MicroSD card slot is accessible under the back cover, though there''s no need to remove the battery or power down to swap it. The music player interface is easy enough to use without being particularly sophisticated.</p>\n<p>The sound quality is actually surprisingly decent for a budget handset; it comes supplied with a set of earphones that portray more depth and range than we''d expect at this price point. The limitations of the music player interface mean it won''t be an MP3 player replacement any time soon, but it sounds fine if you want to carry a bundle of tunes around to listen to on your phone.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, there''s no standard 3.5mm headphone socket to upgrade ear wear – but that''s unlikely to put off this phone''s target buyer.</p>\n<p>As well as the music player, an FM radio is included, offering another straightforward audio entertainment option. Like the music player, this can be played through the loud speaker, if you''re not fussed about sound quality.</p>\n<p>Imaging isn''t a particularly strong suit for the 533, as you''d expect with a basic 1.3-megapixel camera doing snapping duties. It has got a side camera button to fire it up (long press starts up camera, short press hotkeys the radio), and it does have a few typical cameraphone control options – including exposure, effects and timer – but it really it isn''t up to much.</p>\n<p>Shots are basically up to snap''n''send quality rather than anything more refined, with limited levels of detail. Good light helps image reproduction but with no flash, in low light levels, performance is typically poor. Some basic editing software allows you to tweak images and add effects.</p>\n<p>Although it can shoot video, footage is poor quality; recording in low resolution 176x144 pixels resolution, it is very jerky and low-grade even by pre-pay phone standards.</p>\n<p>But the bottom line on this handset is of course the price, and what you get is still reasonable for the cash. Bluetooth connectivity is supported, and the 533 has a fairly standard set of mobile organiser apps and tools included too. Calendar, timer, to do lists, stopwatch, alarm, calculator and unit convertor functions are present.</p>\n<p>It has a basic Openwave Wap browser too, with embedded links to the Vodafone live! service. A Vodafone Messenger/Windows Live Messenger instant messaging client is pre-loaded, plus online links for the online Vodafone Mail email service. A selection of half a dozen demo Java games are included, which you can choose to buy via Vodafone live!</p>\n<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>\n<p>Getting the basics right on a low-budget phone is essential, and the voice calling performance of the 533 is suitably spot-on. We had no problems with call clarity or audio reliability during our trials. Battery performance is reasonable; Vodafone estimates that it can achieve up to 250 hours of standby time, or 150 minutes of talktime, which is modest for a non-3G handset nowadays. In our normal-use, tests took the phone managed around 2 days on average between charges.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Sure, it''d be easy to point out what the 533 lacks, and the weak points in its specifications. But at this sort of wallet-friendly rock-bottom price level, the Vodafone 533 Catwalk Collection model offers a good deal that''s hard to be harsh about, with a bit more than just the basics in a bright and breezy, eye-catchingly styled sliderphone design.</p>', '', 'front-vodafone-533--combined-160-80.jpg', 'vodafone-533.png', NULL, 'In these credit-crunched times, not everyone', 'In these credit-crunched times, not everyone is looking out for the latest do-everything mobile.

The camera button is in a similar place, and not only does it require a really hard press to start up, but it''s also in a slightly tricky-to-hit place.</p><p>On the left-hand side is the silencer switch and the volume control, with the microUSB port at the bottom.

There''s also a small optical pad, which works well and lets you swipe a finger to navigate the interface. </p><p>The display itself is a resistive panel and is frustratingly unresponsive. It''s bright and easy to see in most conditions, but it fails to stand out in any way. </p><p>The onscreen keyboard is infuriatingly inaccurate to use. Presses of the screen have to be particularly firm otherwise your touch won''t register. As a result, it''s very difficult to strike up a fast typing rhythm. We also found the text correction software was quite poor, compounding the issue. </p><p>The lack of a built-in stylus is noticeable when trying to click the icons at the very top, and it''s particularly tricky for those with larger hands. The phone would also benefit hugely from having a Back button, as without it you''ll find yourself repeatedly starting again from the home page. </p><p><strong>S-Class</strong></p><p>The S-Class interface brings with it several home pages and you can swipe a finger to move from one to the next. Pages include one with customisable widgets &ndash; letting you see items such as a calendar, clock and calculator, and the menus will be familiar to existing LG users. </p><p>The problem comes when you want to access Windows Mobile features, as the operating system is so well hidden it''s difficult to access. While some users may prefer this, we found the handset was more confusing than a regular S-Class device and slower than most Windows Mobile smartphones. </p><p>One advantage the Windows OS brings is the inclusion of Office Mobile software. We wouldn''t want to use it to create documents from scratch, due to the unresponsive display, but it''s nice to be able to open and edit your files when on the move. It''s also easier than ever to set up an email account, with support built in for webmail services such as Google Mail, along with more business-orientated clients such as Microsoft''s Exchange. </p><p><strong>Compact design </strong></p><p>The handset itself features a neat and compact design and it''s a lot easier to slip into a pocket than many other touchscreen rivals. The plastics are all study enough for daily use and the weight adds to the robust feel. </p><p>The 5-megapixel camera produces reasonable images but, as with most other features on this handset, it doesn''t really stand out from the crowd. There''s also a noticeable lag between pressing the shutter and your photograph being taken &ndash; often resulting in blurred photographs. Connectivity is top-notch though, with 3G/HSDPA, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built in. </p><p>Overall, with its unusual mix of operating systems, this handset isn''t the success it could have been.

One is that the phone can get a bit greasy after extended use and even slip through your fingers. You''ll smudge up the screen quickly. </p><p>Google also needs to think seriously about some of the power saving decisions on the Nexus One. Of course, you can configure when the screen blanks and when the phone goes into a sleep state, but the default options are impractical: to resume the phone, you have to press the power switch. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/1googlenexusone4-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Google nexus one"></figure></p><p>For those who are used to just touching the screen to resume, or pressing any other button, you might get frustrated quickly.

It''s still a pain, however.</p><p>And then there is just the overall experience of using the Nexus One. In many ways, the Nexus One is a geek phone - there are a plethora of menu options for built-in apps and an exhaustive list of options under settings. </p><p>There are so many techie details to explore that new users might get confused by simple operations, such as how to archive an email.

Infrared! We haven''t seen that in years, and we''re not even sure if it was ever really needed on any phone, but couple that with the old charger adaptor in the box and the N900 has a very old-school feel to it.</p><p>But dig a little deeper and you''ll see why. We''ve pointed out before how this is an ''enthusiasts'' device, according to Nokia, and while the manual says that this port doesn''t control any pre-installed applications, it can be used by third-party developers. This means the N900 has the capability to do things like become a universal remote, which is pretty cool indeed.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nokian90003-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia n900"></figure></p><p>Scoot round to the right-hand side and you''ll find the lock key, which is a little square slider button.

Given the amount of phones these days that have a , leaving the headphone connection exposed, this is a welcome change.</p><p>However this did bring up one problem in that when holding the phone with the headphones plugged in, it was very uncomfortable, with the plug right in the way of where you would naturally want to hold it.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nokian90004-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia n900"></figure></p><p>On both the right- and left-hand side sit the stereo speakers, which offer some pretty decent sound for such a device. Also on the left-hand side is the microUSB slot, which has no cover and will likely get easily filled with bits (we have no idea what bits are, but we know they live in your pocket).</p><p>Below the headphone jack is where the stylus sits, easily pulled out using a fingernail. We don''t like its presence on the N900, and don''t really see a need for it, but if you''ve got a resistive screen you might as well use it on the odd occasion you can''t hit some icon or other. </p><p>On the back of the phone is the camera and stand. We''d prefer to see said stand (like that seen on the and ) more central, as the weight of the N900 always makes the phone seem unstable.

If you''re a smartphone connoisseur (and we assume you probably are given that you''re looking at the chunky-yet-powerful N900) then you''re probably adept at using a touchscreen - and we''re so used to such as well that we often forgot to slide open the keyboard. </p><p>But when you do it simply feels right in the hand, both in one- and two-handed operation, although the pressure to use it in landscape mode for nearly everything is annoying as there are times when you want to scroll through a list or something with just a single digit, and it''s not easy to do so.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nokian90013-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia n900"></figure></p><p>While the depth might not be best suited to iPhone- or Hero-like singl- hand operation, it''s no problem to use the phone in day-to-day life, even if it leaves a more than unsightly bulge in the trousers.

Oh, and they want it to be affordable too, even without a contract.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/colours-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC smart"></figure></p><p>You can usually spot a budget phone at 20 paces, but that''s simply not the case with the HTC Smart. Put simply, it looks and feels every bit as good as the , which is pretty impressive for a brand new handset that can be had for free on a &pound;15 per month contract, or &pound;100 on prepay. </p><p>With dimensions of 104 x 55 x 12.8mm the Smart is very comfortable to hold, while at 108g, it won''t weigh you down either. That makes it roughly the same size and weight as the , which is no bad thing. </p><p>O2 offers the Smart in either black or white, but HTC sent us a pink version. Even in pink this is a good-looking phone, with the chrome accents around the edges breaking things up a little. </p><p>The front of the Smart is dominated by the 2.8-inch screen, which is surprisingly bright and vibrant for a budget phone. </p><p>The 320 x 240 QVGA resolution gives the game away slightly, but it doesn''t spoil the party for the most part. The one area where the resolution really is a limitation is when you''re using the web browser, but more about that later.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/rear-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC smart"></figure></p><p>Below the screen are four buttons, the largest being (by some margin) the Back button. This is something of multi-function button, though, since it doubles as the phone''s Home button, too. </p><p>Pressing the Back button once will generally take you to the previous page/menu, while pressing and holding it will take you to the main Home screen. Pressing the Back button while on the main Home screen will then open up the Programs menu. </p><p>Either side of the Back button are Call and Hang-up buttons, while the final front fascia control is a Menu button located just below the screen.</p><p>Along the bottom you''ll find an older style mini-USB port, rather than the newer micro USB connector. The only other connector is a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is always good to see on any phone, especially a budget model. </p><p>The Smart sports 256MB ROM and 256MB RAM, but there''s a microSD card slot for increasing storage space up to a maximum of 32GB. A nice touch is that the card slot is accessible without having to remove the battery. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sd-card-slot-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC smart"></figure></p><p>There''s a relatively modest 300MHz Qualcomm CPU beating at the heart of the Smart, although there didn''t seem to be any issues when it came to general speed of operation. </p><p>HSDPA speeds are limited to 3.6mbps, rather than the 7.2mbps theoretical maximum seen on higher end phones. Obviously real world data speeds are limited by your network, but in use the Smart did feel a little sluggish in the data department.</p><p>That slightly disappointing cellular data performance is compounded by the fact that the Smart doesn''t have Wi-Fi, so even when you''re at home or in the office, you can''t make use of a fast connection. </p><p>You do get Bluetooth with A2DP though, so the Smart will happily work with a hands-free kit, while also pumping music to your car stereo. </p><p>Another major departure from the recent trend of HTC phones is the use of Qualcomm''s Brew mobile platform.

It isn''t exactly the ideal operating system for a smartphone these days, not least because the much-improved Windows Phone 7 is about to make its first appearance soon. </p><p>But Garmin appears to be working on the basis that the business community will remain committed to this version of Windows Mobile for a while, and the upcoming Android based Garmin Asus N&uuml;vifone A10 will have more mass appeal, so here we are with the Garmin Asus N&uuml;vifone M10.</p><p>With HDSPA, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS and a 5MP camera the smartphone basics are covered. The presence of a 600MHz processor sounds fair, though not great, on paper. </p><p>You''ve got 512MB of ROM plus 4GB of flash storage and room for a microSD card too.

While real buttons can be a nice thing to have, the optical trackpad won''t be missed. More precise text editing is now built into the OS, making it redundant, and losing it has meant HTC could shave a little off the device''s height.</p><p>It''s now 60 x 115 x 11.6mm, and weighs in at a middle-of-the-road 130g. While 11.6mm isn''t hugely thick, it''s certainly lagging behind in the skinny war going on between Apple, Samsung and Sony Ericsson. Maybe HTC''s got it right, though &ndash; let them worry about fitting the battery in, and just make perfectly good normal phones.</p><p>The Desire S doesn''t feel thick &ndash; it''s a nice size in the hand, and the curved sides make it quite comfortable to hold.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/volume20rocker-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC desire s"></figure></p><p>The screen retains its 3.7-inch size and 480 x 800 resolution with Super LCD technology.

Again, it''s a little too small thanks to the extreme thinness of the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S, but it''s sensitive enough to make taking photos straightforward. </p><p>Also, holding it down wherever you are in the phone''s menus boots up the camera. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/arc-s-hands-on-9-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony ericsson xperia arc s"></figure></p><p>The top edge houses the power button and HDMI connector (but there''s no HDMI cable in the box), plus you can see the proximity sensor that deactivates the screen when you''re making a call.

From the days of making (not so great) Windows Mobile handsets for networks, it''s found its identity and is now riding high with a hugely recognisable brand around the world. Android was its saviour (and still is) but Windows hasn''t been forgotten. </p><p>So, what''s in a name? Well, quite a lot actually. The Titans were giant beasts from ancient Greek mythology.

At 4.7-inches with a 480 x 800 resolution, not only is it sharp, it takes up most of the front of the device, making it the largest screen on a Windows Phone device.</p><p>Naturally, it''s capacitive (we shudder to think of the days we''d have to poke our i-Mate Jam with a stylus) and colours are vivid and vibrant.

use, with scuffs, scratches and chips on the body unavoidable.</p>\n<p>And although the scratch-resistant display fared well against one rather large accidental drop onto concrete, the smartphone''s corners suffered a more aesthetic-blemishing fate, with considerable nicks and chinks removed and the odd dent more than slightly apparent.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img

We tested the Jetpack 890L in the San Francisco Bay Area including South San Francisco and Oakland and routinely achieved download speeds around 5 Mbps and upload speeds upwards of 3 Mbps.</p><p>Of course, the speed of your particular connection is dependent upon the strength of your cellular connection. For instance, when using the device as a mobile hotspot on the San Francisco Bay Ferry (in the middle of the Bay) even though we were connected our speeds were dramatically slower.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/imgp0812-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Verizon Jetpack 890L 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot"></figure></p><p>Even though the Jetpack 890L is offered by Verizon Wireless it''s a world device. According to Verizon the mobile hotspot will work in more than 200 countries with more than 125 of those countries offering 3G speeds. In those countries that don''t support 3G speeds the Jetpack 890L boasts quad-band EDGE and HSPA support. This means that international users won''t enjoy the speed that those of us in the States experience.</p><p>The device itself is pretty bulky, especially when compared to other mobile hotspots. It''s 3.5 by 3.5 inches and a little more than a half-an-inch thick. That said, this isn''t really gonna be that much of an issue since you''re just gonna throw it in a bag.</p><p>The Jetpack 890L rocks a removable 1700mAh battery but we were pretty disappointed with the overall battery life. In our tests we routinely got about four hours of battery life. On the upside, the Jetpack 890L can operate while it''s charging and you can also connect it to your laptop via the included micro USB cable.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/imgp0848-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Verizon Jetpack 890L 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot"></figure></p><p>Verizon boasts that the Jetpack 890L has a range of around 100 but things started to drop off for us at about 80 feet. Of course, being a mobile device this shouldn''t be a problem as the thing can pretty easily go with you.</p><p>Again on the hardware side we were bummed that the Jetpack 890L doesn''t have a MicroSD slot. So there''s no using the device as a shared drive between devices.</p><p>Speaking of devices the Jetpack 890L can support up to 10 devices simultaneously. This number drops to five when not in 4G LTE mode. Setting up your connection is super easy with the Jetpack 890L. We charged it, fired it up, and within seconds our mobile hotspot was alive and kicking. Every mobile device we threw at it had no trouble finding it: , , , laptops and cellphones.</p><p>We were easily able to customize the network settings (firewall, router, WAN, security and Wi-Fi settings) using Verizon''s web-based interface. While the web-based interface was easy the 1.5-inch black and white OLED status display on the device itself leaves a lot to be desired. There''s a simple status display on the front that has three physical buttons below it. That said, navigating around the Jetpack''s UI is pretty awful. Fortunately, once everything is up and running you won''t have to muck around in the UI much.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/imgp0806-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Verizon Jetpack 890L 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot"></figure></p><p>Of course, the UI displays things like the name of the network as well as the default password. The password is also printed on a sticker on the bottom of the device. As for physical buttons there''s a power switch and a reset button and the micro USB charging port is also right there.</p><p>While Verizon''s 4G LTE network is super-fast and pretty much available everywhere in the States the pricing structure is complicated, expensive and unlimited data isn''t an option. Data plans for the Jetpack 890L start at 5GB for $50 a month or 10GB for $80. As TechRadar  Verizon doesn''t offer unlimited data plans so hardcore web users will want to be careful about their usage. Watch a couple of TV shows on Hulu Plus, Netflix or stream some football games on NFL Sunday Ticket and you''re done. Verizon offers additional data at $10 per GB so at least you won''t have to worry about overages.</p><h3>We liked</h3><p>The overall performance of Verizon''s 4G LTE network was great. We maintained a reliable connection, and had pretty good 4G download speeds. The jetpack is slick looking, and it''s easy to toss in your bag on your way out the door. The fact that it connects with up 10 devices is also pretty generous.</p><h3>We disliked</h3><p>Connecting 10 devices is where the generosity ends, as usual Verizon''s data plans are pretty miserly. The lack of an unlimited options means we''re forever watching the clock as we surf and watch web videos. We also wish the battery life was better. The fact that it''s removable helps, but a bigger cell would make it a more reliable device. Also, that UI could use some real work.</p><h3>Verdict</h3><p>If you need a reliable Wi-Fi hotspot that''s super fast in the States but also works in more than 200 countries you''ll no doubt be pleased with the Jetpack 890L 4G LTE. Of course, the lack of an unlimited data option may be a deal-breaker for many power users. Folks who already have unlimited data plans on their cell phones, via T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Verizon or Sprint, may be better served to just use their mobile phones as Wi-FI hotspots.</p> ', '', 'ztejetpackside02-160-80.jpg', 'imgp0812-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'For road warriors, relying on the goodwill of others to provide you with reliable internet', 'For road warriors, relying on the goodwill of others to provide you with reliable internet access is a risky proposition.

Motorola launched the Razr line. </p><p>This was a time when Nokia ruled the phone world; an age where Ericsson and Motorola were the other big boys, Samsung was a bit of an also-ran trying to compete but struggling, and Apple... well, it had not long launched the iPod, which "put 1,000 songs in your pocket." </p><p>Indeed, Apple teamed up with Motorola to launch the first iTunes enabled phone, the  (which was a dismal failure) before deciding that it could do the whole thing better itself.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/razri-handson-10-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Razr i review"></figure></p><p>Apple''s iPhone line has now arguably become the most successful of all time - five million  handsets sold in the first three days. Which puts Motorola''s 130m Razrs in four years into perspective.</p><p>Motorola''s Razr line never really died. It just fell into a coma, with the occasional slumber of consciousness across various iterations. And now, under the ownership (although, perhaps not the hands-on stewardship) of parent company Google, the Razr is being given another more high profile outing.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/razri-handson-14-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Razr i review"></figure></p><p>With the above in mind, it''s ironic that when we opened the box and pulled the Motorola Razr i out, the first thing we thought was "wow - it looks like an iPhone 5". We know that will have some diehard Apple fanboys clutching their pearls - and we''ll probably go to iHell for saying it - but hold the Motorola Razr i in your mitts and you''ll see what we mean.</p><p>Firstly, the size. At 122.5 x 60.9 x 8.3mm (4.8 x 2.4 x 0.3 inches), it''s about the same width and height, albeit a little fatter and slightly heavier, than the iPhone 5. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/odf3b-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Razr i review"></figure></p><p>It also feels similar - the mixture of Kevlar and glass instead of aluminum and glass gives it that premium feel, and Motorola has gone down the same industrialised route as Apple. </p><p>Yes, the lines are not as precise - there''s the odd bit of metal thrown in there on the front and there are lots of screws (six! Yes, six screws on show ,with no attempt to hide them) plus various buttons. It''s not as ''clean'' or minimalist as an iPhone, but we can definitely see what Motorola is trying to do here. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/razri-handson-05-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Razr i review"></figure></p><p>Clearly, it wants the Motorola Razr i to look tough, yet chic; to take that "I''m the man" but also "I''m beautiful" approach in the same way an iPhone does. Like a warehouse conversion apartment in a scruffy part of London, inhabited by somebody elegant and wealthy. It''s a perfect mix and blend of two worlds that works together.</p><p>Up top, there''s not much to report apart from a headphone jack, while the right-hand side has two metal buttons (power/standby and camera). </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/razri-handson-08-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Razr i review"></figure></p><p>The Motorola Razr i tapers off around the bottom, while the left-hand side holds the micro USB sync/charging port and a little plastic flap that enables you to slot in your SIM and microSD card, so you can expand the 8GB of provided storage by another 64GB. </p><p>And those screws... Those damn screws that we''ve looked at over and over again, unable to decide if they look cool or terrible.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/razri-handson-06-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Razr i review"></figure></p><p>A brief mention of the SIM tray - and we would recommend removing children from the area when inserting it, since this phone will make you utter many profanities. The simplest of tasks - inserting a micro SIM into a Motorola Razr i - was, unfortunately, one of the most laborious things we''ve ever done. In fact, we''d go so far as to say it is hideous. </p><p>There''s no spring, no real guidance there, and we spent 45 minutes trying to do it. The tweezers were out at one point. We''ll never get those minutes back.

It''s obviously there for a reason, but it takes the gloss off the experience ever so slightly.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is a pretty great display. It''s smaller than many these days, at 4.3 inches across, and with a 540 x 960 pixel display (256ppi density). Being a Super AMOLED panel, blacks are very black and colours are incredibly vivid. Whites can appear a little bit yellow, which we noticed on websites and in the Gmail app, but it''s nothing too severe.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/razri-handson-01-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Razr i review"></figure></p><p>In fact, our only complaint with the screen is that pixel density. It shows just how much we''ve changed that we now think that''s a little ''third world'', but it just can''t match something like the ''s Retina display or similar panels on the  or .</p><p>It''s not bad - and regular users probably won''t even notice. But spotting pixels has become a bit of a pastime for many of us as technology has moved on, and you can definitely see them when you zoom into text, which is a shame, because it''s the only fly in a perfectly concocted ointment.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/razri-handson-02-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola Razr i review"></figure></p><p>And of course, the other selling point is the chip inside.

3.7-inch display came to life providing a crisp, bright display, but it''s not as stunning as Apple''s Retina offering or the Super AMOLED tech we see on Samsung''s smartphones.</p>\n<p>It''s disappointing to see the Ti isn''t running the latest version of Android, instead you''re stuck with version 4.0.4, affectionately known as Ice Cream Sandwich.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img

experience.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the shutter speed on the Vertu Ti was disappointingly slow, and images didn''t look great with blurred shots and generally grainy results produced in our admittedly poorly lit surroundings.</p>\n<p>On the plus side there is a decent panorama mode available, plus the 8MP camera round the back can shoot 1080p video.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img

Google''s Chrome both of which are perfectly capable options, although we were unable to test the surfing speed as there was a lack of web connection in the underground event space.</p>\n<p>We''ve become accustomed to large screens on mobile phones and even Apple has woken up and managed to squeeze a 4-inch offering on the iPhone 5, which leaves the 3.7-inch display on the Vertu Ti feeling a tad small.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ti-handson-27-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Vertu Ti review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>This became more noticeable when we came to using the keyboard, as the keys felt cramped and although the default Android input method was present we did make a few mistakes as we tapped out some messages.</p>\n<p>It''s not the end of the world and with the  store on the handset you can easily download a better version in next to no time - we recommend SwiftKey if you fancy taking a look.</p>\n<p>Video playback also suffers slightly from the smaller screen and while it''s perfectly fine for general usage you can notice a lack of quality if you''re watching a movie.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ti-handson-26-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Vertu Ti review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>This won''t be an issue if the Vertu Ti had a price tag which reflected its specifications, but for the money you actually need to stump up we kind of hoped it could match the likes of the iPhone 5 and .</p>\n<p>The same feeling extends across the whole device because when you consider that price tag we can''t get our heads around why the Vertu Ti doesn''t challenge the big guns in the mobile market.</p>\n<p>Sure

With the Ativ moniker, it stands among the , , and  as Samsung devices built to use the latest  and  software.</p>\n<p>While Microsoft''s mobile OS is still young and the Windows app store is still being populated, store shelves are filling up with WP8 devices. Both HTC and Nokia have substantial offerings, the  and  and the  and , respectively.</p>\n<p>Just as Microsoft''s mobile platform is finding its legs, competition is heating up for the title of flagship WP8 device. However, for many customers the Ativ S may not even be in the running due to uneven carrier treatment. In Australia, the U.S. and in the U.K., the Ativ S is only a 3G device. You''ll have to be a lucky Canadian on Bell to experience 4G LTE speeds with the Ativ S.</p>\n<p>While we loved the Ativ S''s big display, and found it a subdued alternative to colorful handsets like the 8X and Lumia lineup, it suffers the same limitations as other WP8 devices. Also, the lack of 4G support in most places should have power users hesitant to jump in. In the U.S., they''ll want to wait for Verizon''s rumored , which could end up being the 4G version of the Ativ S we so desire.</p>\n<p>While Samsung has crafted a handsome, reliable device, the hunt for the ultimate WP8 device is still on. Read on to find out what great touches the Korean manufacturer has brought to the WP8 space, and the reasons why consumers should still be a tad hesitant to embrace the Ativ S.</p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>Samsung''s Ativ S bears a very strong resemblance to both the  and SIII, to the point where it feels like one of those phones retrofitted with WP8 software.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Ativ S has two major accomplishments under its belt: it''s the thinnest build of any Windows Phone 8 device and it has the largest screen. This alone makes it deserving of attention from consumers.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsungativs-press-05-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Ativ S review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>That AMOLED display is 4.8-inches, just a little bit bigger than the WP8 device with the second largest screen, the  at 4.5-inches. At 306 pixels per inch, the display is actually less dense than the HTC and Nokia competition, but you''d never know it with your naked eye. This large, well-lit display really makes those Live Tiles sing, and the viewing angles are nothing short of spectacular. Even in bright sunlight we had no trouble looking at the Ativ S.</p>\n<p>The body of the Ativ S isn''t bad to look at either. It has a long, brushed metallic exterior, like a Galaxy S3. Don''t let that chromed appearance fool you though, just like the S3 the Ativ S is all plastic.</p>\n<p>The Ativ S''s slim body and metallic design give it a mature, subdued appearance that we find appealing. Consumers who found the candy-colored HTC 8X too playful or the Lumia 920 too obviously plastic will be delighted with it.</p>\n<p>However, the Ativ S is so slick it''s downright slippery. It almost slid out of our hands on a number of occasions. That''s not something that would ever happen with a grippy HTC 8X or 8S. Hopefully there will be stylish flip covers for the Ativ S, just like the S3.</p>\n<p>Inside, the Ativ S packs power. It doesn''t have an S3''s quad-core, but its 1.5 GHz dual-core is nothing to sneeze at. There''s also 1GB of RAM, and the option of 16 or 32GB of internal memory.</p>\n<p>Fans of removable batteries and micro-SD cards rejoice, the Ativ S has both. Just like an S3, the thin backplate is removable, revealing a 2,300 mAh battery, micro-SIM and SD card slot. That, combined with ample internal memory, makes it ideal photos and videos.</p>\n<p>As with the S3, the backplate is shockingly thin. Taking it off always made us feel like we might break it, but it held up well to multiple removals, and the bending we subjected it to.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsungativs-press-02-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Ativ S review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>On the rear you''ll also spy an 8-megapixel lense and LED flash. There''s also the long, thin speaker grill we often see on Samsung phones.</p>\n<p>The top right side of the Ativ S has the lock/power button used for waking the phone and turning it off. On the bottom right lies a dedicated camera button, a signature of Windows Phone 8 design. It''s a choice we agree with, as it''s very convenient for grabbing a quick shot.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/right20side-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Ativ S review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>On the left side is your standard volume rocker.

As with the , it''s a small detail that detracts just the tiniest bit from overall premium feel of the phone.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Ativ S is a very handsome, smartly designed phone. While long, thin and metallic has become something of a standard design for Android devices, this is a new look for the revamped Windows Phone. It sets it apart from the more colorful competition, and while some consumers may balk at its size, a subdued, thin look plus removable storage and battery make it a very viable option.</p>', '', 'samsungativs-press-04-160-80.jpg', 'samsungativs-press-05-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'Producing powerful and balanced devices like the and , Samsung is a force to be reckoned with in', 'Producing powerful and balanced devices like the and , Samsung is a force to be reckoned with in the Android smartphone market.

It''s a bit firm for our liking, and the way it curves up at the edges makes it a bit sharp when you slide your finger up and down the side. Being at the top, though, means you are unlikely to hit it accidentally.</p>\n<p>The opposite side houses an uncovered microUSB port. ZTE have left the back pretty sparse as well, with nothing but the camera, speaker and handset branding. The plastic chassis wraps around, and is the first visual clue to the price of the KIS.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, unlike some devices, including the high-end  and the , the battery cover is removable.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/20121109193226-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="ZTE KIS review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Sliding a fingernail in the slight groove in the top right of the cover pops the cover off very easily.</p>\n<p>The plastic is thin and flexible; again more clues as to the price of the ZTE Kis. Behind the battery cover is the SIM-card slot, 1,400mAh battery and microSD card slot.</p>\n<p>The microSD card slot isn''t easy to use, having to lay the card flat against the Kis and slide it in.</p>\n<p>We often found ourselves dropping the card on the sofa and losing it down the back, so a pop in/out slot would have been preferred. We were impressed with the device''s size, as everything is easy to hit one handed.</p>\n<p>The 120g weight means that you notice it in your pocket, without feeling that it is weighing you down. It is also comfortable to use for long periods, and we don''t envisage you dropping it (we didn''t, and we''re not exactly graceful).</p>\n<p>The 3.5 inch HVGA TFT screen will never win any prizes. On the plus side, its bright enough to use outdoors and the capacitive buttons are very responsive. The viewing angle is pretty poor; we certainly can''t imagine watching full-length movies on the Kis.</p>\n<p>Overall, we can imagine you wanting to show the style of the ZTE Kis off to your friends, and making them guess how much you spent on it.</p>', '', 'kis-press-01-160-80.jpg', '20121109192955-580-100.jpg', NULL, 'Coming out of network-branded obscurity is a path that many mobile phone manufacturers are', 'Coming out of network-branded obscurity is a path that many mobile phone manufacturers are taking.

Not so much an amazing feat of engineering, but a clever trick.</p>\n<p>With dimensions of 132.4 x 66.2 x 10.1mm, the HTC 8X is fairly average in size. But it''s thinner round the edges to give the impression it''s more svelte than it actually is. Not that this matters because it looks and feels thin most of the time and the slight curve around the back means it sits well, both on a surface and in the hand.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htc8xreview4-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC 8X review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In fact, in the hand, it looks the same size as the HTC One X, despite the appearance given in our picture above.</p>\n<p>Add to that the material the HTC 8X is made of – polycarbonate, like the One X – and you instantly have in your mitts a handset that feels like a real premium device. It''s a unibody design so it''s all nice and neat (win) but at the expense of a memory slot and replaceable battery (fail).</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htc8xreview7-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC 8X review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The front of the HTC 8X is taken up by the display. If you like what Nokia did with the Lumia 800, or indeed what HTC did with the One X, you''ll be a fan of this too.</p>\n<p>The screen just looks like it''s been stuck on top of the phone and adds to that premium feel. There''s also a splash of colour around the earpiece to remind you that the two are linked.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htc8xreview5-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC 8X review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Next to this, you''ll find the front-facing wide-angled camera, and the three Windows Phone softkeys at the bottom – back, search and menu.</p>\n<p>That screen is an HD display at 720x1280.

Although we''re not necessarily fans of lock buttons on top of larger phones due to the awkwardness they present, here, we weren''t too fussed.</p>\n<p>Due to the shape of the handset and the way it sits, it''s easy enough to press with the index finger whether you''re a left or right hander. Our only complaint is it is quite subtle and a few times, we had to feel around to find it if we were looking elsewhere. It doesn''t stick out much.</p>\n<p>The left hand side of the HTC 8X is completely bare, whilst all you''ll find down at the bottom is the micro USB charging and syncing port.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htc8xreview8-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC 8X review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The volume rocker is on the right and below it is a camera shutter key. We are always pleased to see these because it makes the art of launching the camera and taking a photo so much easier than messing about with software, no matter how good said software is.</p>\n<p>There''s also a tray for getting that micro SIM in – but you''ll need to use a special tool to open it so make sure you keep it in a safe place.</p>\n<p>The rear of the HTC 8X is a thing of beauty. That polycarbonate body really sets it off – as does the colour which sits beneath a silver HTC logo and another displaying the Beats Audio heritage. And of course, there''s that main snapper with LED light which HTC promises will deliver amazing results.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htc8xreview3-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC 8X review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The 8X will be pitching itself right against Nokia''s latest Lumia range – and with the  also coming in a number of colourful iterations, telling them apart may be harder for those who aren''t as used to Windows Phone products.</p>\n<p>But there is a difference in that the HTC 8X doesn''t come with  connectivity in the UK, whilst the Lumia 920 does.

Its already made a couple of phones under the Cat name, and it launched the Cat B15 at  in Barcelona. This rugged device has been available in Europe for a little while, and is making its North American debut at a pre-show event for .</p>\n<h3>Rubber outside, Jelly Bean inside</h3>\n<p>The Cat B15 has a rubber and aluminum shell with a sweet Android 4.1:  center. It''s built to make calls and survive falls; with just a 5-megapixel camera and dual-core 1GHz processor, it''s not designed for much else.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/imgp1967-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Cat B15 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>As we mentioned, the Cat B15 has been available in Europe for a while now, and can actually be purchased as an unlocked device directly from Cat for $349/£300. Representatives showing the device couldn''t name the U.S. carriers that will carry it.</p>\n<h3>No 4G here, sadly</h3>\n<p>However, we''ll tell you that the Cat B15 is a GSM phone, so therefore AT&amp;T and T-Mobile are your likely candidates. No dice with GSM carriers Sprint and Verizon. It''s also 3G only, so forget about up-to-date data speeds.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/imgp1935-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Cat B15 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Like a lot of rubberized and ruggedized phones, such as the , the Cat B15 looks like a phone in a heavy rubber case. Phones like this are bulky by nature, but it does seem like Cat has slimmed down the B15 as much as possible.</p>\n<h3>Looks like a handsome screwdriver</h3>\n<p>The B15 is just shy of 5-inches, with a width of 2.7-inches and .58-inches of thickness. It also feels pretty good, and doesn''t weigh too much, just 5.9 oz. Its rubber body casing and aluminum sides give it the look of a toolbox or an eye-catching screwdriver.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/imgp1867-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Cat B15 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The display is a 4-inch 480 x 800 screen resolution. But get this: it''s designed to detect and stand up to a wet finger, because the Cat B15 is waterproof at a depth of up to 1 meter, for thirty minutes. We actually had the chance to wet our digits and give the phone a swipe, and it did indeed work. Frequent snorkelers, we may have your next phone here.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/imgp1930-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Cat B15 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The manufacturer also claims the B15 is "impervious to dust," which is likely thanks to all the rubber seals fitted in each and every port. The headphone jack seals up, as does the micro-USB charging port.</p>\n<h3>Treat it like a rented phone</h3>\n<p>It''s also rated for a drop of up to six feet, which should be more than enough to survive a tumble from your hand to the floor. Cat representatives on hand were eager to drop the phone and prove this claim.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/imgp1987-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Cat B15 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Getting back to the build, one of the things we like least about a smartphone case is how it makes the buttons difficult to push. Luckily, the B15''s yellow rubber buttons weren''t too bad. They didn''t press as easy as an ''s unlock button, but they didn''t take too much effort, either.</p>\n<h3>It opens up, no mallet required</h3>\n<p>You wouldn''t think it, but the B15 actually has an open body design. It takes some doing, but you can unlatch the back and open it up to reveal a 2000 mAh battery and microSD slot. There''s only 4GB of on board storage, so it''s a good thing you can add an additional 32GB.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/imgp2059-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Cat B15 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Of course, this isn''t really a media centric or image snapping phone. The camera is only 5-mp and the processor is low-end, but flipping across menus and diving into the app drawer, the B15 was no slouch. We didn''t detect any stuttering, and the browser opened with acceptable speed.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/imgp1974-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Cat B15 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>We''d guess that''s Jelly Bean at work, as the B15 runs a version that''s darn close to stock. We noticed just one toolbar that smacked of manufacturer meddling.</p>\n<h3>Early Verdict</h3>\n<p>When a brand like Cat enters the smartphone game, it''s tempting to look at it as selling a name, not a phone. Cat has parleyed its black and yellow good looks and blue collar street cred into clothes, boots, watches and more. Its even appeared at London Fashion Week.</p>\n<p>We won''t know if Cat is a smartphone dilettante until we have the B15 in for a full review, but there''s a good chance the phone could prove it''s worth, and frankly, phones like this could use a little style. We''ve all seen far too many hideously shattered iPhones and over-the-top protective cases. If someone could sell a tougher phone to that crowd, not just construction workers, they''d be doing the world a favor.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/imgp1964-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Cat B15 review" /><figcaption>We''ll take rubber over this any day</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Ultimately though, the B15 seems like a budget phone in a well-constructed case. It''s 3G only, has a weak processor and camera, and the display is none to sharp. The battery is a bit small at 2000 mAh, which is worrying on a phone that should be reliable above all else.</p>\n<p>However, the close to stock Android OS intrigues us, and we have to admit, we''re charmed by the phone''s sturdiness, and the eagerness of Cat reps to beat it up for us.

Thanks to the Facebook Home overlay, it takes some digging to realize the HTC First is running  with no manufacturer or carrier tweaking.</p><p>There''s actually an excellent stock Android experience to be had here, one with solid battery life thanks to a small screen and restrained dual-core processor. There''s also fast data service, provided by LTE coverage from AT&amp;T. That''s something you can''t get on the other best stock Android experience in town, the .</p><p>This comes once you''ve disabled Facebook Home, however.

Posts are there right from the lock screen, using friends'' cover photos as backgrounds.</p><p>Even SMS text messaging, that old standby of the smartphone, has gotten all Facebooked. On the HTC First it''s been baked into the social network''s own Messenger app, and displayed with floating Chat Heads icons.</p><p>So does total Facebook integration add or detract from the Android experience, or is it a whole different beast altogether? Is this a natural evolution, or has the premier service for liking cat videos and posting pics of meals growing cold finally gotten too big for it''s britches? Read on for our take.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>Physically, the HTC First has a very manageable design. It''s just 5-inches tall, like an iPhone 5. That makes it perfect for users who find large handsets, such as the  and the upcoming , too big.</p><p>It nestles nicely in the palm, and has a rubberized body with rounded corners like the . Unlike aluminum bodied phones such as the HTC One and the iPhone 5, it won''t scuff easily, and doesn''t need a case to prevent unsightly scratches.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htcface01-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC First review"></figure></p><p>At 4.37 ounces, it''s a very balanced weight. There''s enough there to be substantial, but it''s light enough to toss in a pocket or purse and forget about.</p><p>HTC phones, even cheaper ones, usually have nice screens, and the First is no exception. The display is 4.3-inches and with a resolution of 1280 x 720, we''re in 720p HD territory.</p><p>As is also the case with HTC phones, the color saturation is well tuned. Colors are true to life, and videos and pictures look quite good. You''d have to hold the First next to the best screens around, the HTC One, iPhone 5 or Galaxy S3, to realize it''s less than premium.</p><p>Continuing with the HTC traditions, the First has a sealed body design. There''s no opening it up to remove the battery or add storage, but this also gives it a very solid build quality. It doesn''t feel like a phone that costs a lot of money, but it doesn''t feel as cheap as, say, the , either.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htcface02-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC First review"></figure></p><p>Below the screen you''ll find three capacitive buttons that light up when the First is active. Other than their looks, this is typical Android stuff. The back button is an arrow pointing left, home is a circle and the option button is a line or dash.</p><p>These symbols don''t correspond to any Facebook features that we''re aware of, so we''re not sure why HTC stepped away from the typical Android design language. Maybe just to give the first Facebook phone a unique look?</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htcface04-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC First review"></figure></p><p>On the back things get normal again. There you''ll also find the lens for a 5-megapixel camera and an LED flash.</p><p>The First is also surprisingly restrained when it comes to branding. For the device meant to introduce the world to Facebook Home, it only has one little F logo on the back, next to HTC and AT&amp;T''s marks. We applaud everyone''s restraint here.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htcface03-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC First review"></figure></p><p>On the right there''s a SIM card tray, which pops out when the included SIM tool or a paper clip is inserted. Above that is the standard mini USB charging port, which struck us as odd placement. It''ll only be annoying if you frequently use your phone while it''s charging.</p><p>Usually the charging port is found on the bottom, below the screen, but instead that''s where the First''s speaker grill resides. This is the only speaker on the phone, and we sometimes had to take care not muffle it when watching videos, so it''s not optimal placement.</p><p>On the upper left side you''ll find a run-of-the-mill volume rocker. It''s easy enough to find and press without looking at your phone.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htcface05-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC First review"></figure></p><p>At the top you''ll find a headphone jack and lock button. As with the iPhone 5, it''s easy to reach the lock button since the phone is just 5-inches. Tall handsets with hard to reach lock buttons on the top, like the HTC One, tend to annoy us.</p><p>One thing that strikes us as missing is a dedicated camera button. If there''s actually someone out there who would like a phone built around Facebook, they would surely be obsessed with picture taking and Instagram. The lack of quick shutter snapping access is a major design fail.</p><p>Overall though, the HTC First is pleasant, if unremarkable to hold. The functional but milquetoast design of this phone, as well as the fact that Facebook Home buries the best Android functionality, reveals the sort of audience the First is chasing. This phone is for someone who wants to forget about their phone when they''re not using it, and only wants to do basic things like text, share pictures and check Facebook when they are using it.</p><p>Furthermore, the immense pleasure we felt at having a Jelly Bean phone of a reigned in size speaks to oversaturation of too-large handsets in the Android market. Won''t someone please make a reasonably sized quad-core LTE phone and let it run stock Android?

The Motorola Razr HD''s Kevlar back has quite a pleasant feel but it''s also quite slippery, making it slightly harder to get a solid grip on than many other phones. The corners also present a slight problem, since being more jagged than most they can be a little uncomfortable, potentially digging into your hand slightly when the handset is held in certain positions.</p><p>Pretty much the only thing on the front of the phone is the 4.7-inch 720 x 1280 screen with a 312ppi pixel density.

Ditto , which is hamstrung by its muddled tablet and desktop variants, and hasn;t had much of an impact so far.</p>\n<p>And then there are a the smaller and virtually unknown mobile platforms such as  that are now starting to get some attention, with probably the most well-known being Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>Several operating systems are fighting for the title of up-and-coming ''third ecosystem'', and Ubuntu is bound to be one of those.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/networklist-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="The Home screen is simple and clean" /><figcaption>The network configuration screen</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Ubuntu was demoed to us on a Samsung Galaxy smartphone amid impressive crowds; there''s obviously interest for something that takes the mobile operating system on another leap.</p>\n<p>It can run both web apps and native apps concurrently and seamlessly, and it''s a unique interface in that it uses no buttons.The tap is no longer the main way to navigate the smartphone; it''s time for ''edge control''.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/header1-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="A typical header" /><figcaption>A typical header, here in Events</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Edge control</h3>\n<p>Everything in Ubuntu is designed around the edges of the smartphone screen, and its first act is to transfix us with the way it relies on gestures and drags rather than taps on apps. Consider the way it manages those time-sapping tasks such as changing the Wi-Fi network you''re on.</p>\n<p>Anyone with an iPhone will know how irritating it is when the device swaps from 3G to any old dodgy pub Wi-Fi network that might be around; swapping back to 3G, or deactivating Wi-Fi, is a long-winded process that can make even the most loyal Apple devotee let out a small, angry yelp of frustration.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/applicationlayout2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Ubuntu" /><figcaption>Gestures are key to Ubuntu</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>On Android the same task involves a similar amount of pages and fumbling about with demanding menus. Ubuntu speeds-up the process by making barely used utility settings, such as Network, Date, Message sand Sound and sound parameters, speedily accessible merely by dragging a finger across the top edge of the phone.</p>\n<p>A rapidly changing carousel of settings appears, and when you get to the one you need, you simply drag drag that finger down to select it and blow it up to full-screen. It gets rid of taps, yes, but it makes things quicker and much cleaner. The ''across, down, select option'' idea isn''t new, and feels much like how, say, Microsoft Word works on a desktop computer, though on a Ubuntu the experience is both compressed and – unless you want to see it – completely hidden from your everyday use of your smartphone. Gone are lists, menus, pages full of options, and other admin annoyances – and even soft-key buttons. Yum.</p>\n<h3>Home page</h3>\n<p>But what does the Ubuntu OS for smartphones look like from the get-go? Since Ubuntu is designed to be a visualisation of each user''s digital life (woah, there) the start-up screen is empty and ready to be customised.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ubuntu20-20home20screen-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="The Home screen is simple and clean" /><figcaption>The Home screen is simple and clean</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>If you want to send a text, surf the web or make a phone call (as if), you pull-in a top-to-bottom line-up of apps by touching the left side of the screen; the likes of Gmail, Phone, Camera, Facebook and Twitter appear as familiar-looking app icons. So does a link to Home, which if pulled to full-screen shows a linear, grid-like area of app icons for the core apps you use.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/gallerytoolbarcrop-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="A typical footer, here in Gallery" /><figcaption>A typical footer, here in Gallery</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Under that is a brief summary of your last few phone calls and messages. Next – and we''re swiping down a continuous page now – is your next important updates; in our demo it was new movie releases, each represented by an app icon-like thumbnail image and nothing else, though it could just as easily be football results, or a news feed.</p>\n<h3>360° design</h3>\n<p>Scroll left from here to People, with Favourites above Missed Calls and Recently In Touch, where everybody is represented by their profile picture, their name, and the day (no meaningless dates – just ''yesterday'' or ''tuesday'') they were in contact.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/listitemssubtitled-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Ubuntu for smartphones" /><figcaption>The People list</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Beyond is Music, where all albums and songs are represented by cover art icons and title only. Scrol right back to the Home page and beyond to Apps, again classified on a quick-look basis; Running Apps is above Frequently Used. Beyond is Video, where again all media content is organised by thumbnail images.</p>\n<h3>Native apps</h3>\n<p>A neat trick of Ubuntu is that it can run both regular smartphone apps and native apps. One of the platform''s own apps is Gallery, an effort to create a timeline-organised history of your life through photos. Yes, it''s a bit like Facebook, though don''t get us started on that particular social media app for smartphones (grrr … adverts). Gallery draws in images from wherever you choose, and orders them by date.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/galleryshare-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Gallery" /><figcaption>Gallery has plenty of sharing options integrated</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Unless you delve a lot deeper, it''s all about content to the exclusion of little-used control; pictures are shown as thumbnails, and by ''event'' (time taken), are scroll-able left and right, and can be made full-screen, but unless you then touch the bottom of the screen you''ll never need to see controls to share, enhance or crop it.</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>Will Ubuntu make an impact? For anyone who has become frustrated with both major operating systems, the streamlined and more intelligently designed, intuitive interface of Ubuntu for smartphones shows more attention to detail than either iOS or Android, though whether it''s revolutionary enough to succeed is debatable. A lot will depend on how it operates on tablets, but Ubuntu''s concentration on content over control makes it an OS that it clearly designed for the mass market.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ubuntu20-20events-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Ubuntu" /><figcaption>The Evens screen</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>', '', 'header1-160-80.jpg', 'header1-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'The tech landscape is dominated by the smart phone, and increasingly, the tablet.

Samsung has kept this layout since the original Galaxy S, and we are big fans, since it means that unlike the newer Nexus phones - the Galaxy Nexus and the Nexus 4 - there is no searching for the on-screen keys. </p><p>Elsewhere on the front of the Galaxy S3 Mini are the speaker and the front-facing VGA camera for Facebook profile pictures, as well as video chats through the likes of Skype.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys3minireview02-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini review"></figure></p><p>The two main ports sit at opposite ends of the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini, with the micro USB sat at the bottom (next to the microphone), and the 3.5mm headphone port on the top. This again follows the standard Samsung layout shown on other Galaxy devices, and we''ve never had a problem with it.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini comes with an advantage over other mid-range devices, since it has a removable battery cover, the Google Nexus 4 being the most notable exception.

It''s located behind the battery, and isn''t a pop-in slot. This means needing to lay the microSD card flat against the Galaxy S3 Mini, and pushing it in, which can get a bit fiddly. </p><p>In all we were very impressed with the design of the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini, but we were more impressed with its more powerful predecessor, the Galaxy S3.

How many more distortions, saturations and warps can one apply to an image before calling it complete? With 36 different effects to choose from - each with their own set of options like thresholds, intensities, tones, angles and brightness levels to adjust - just how much can an image change before posting it to Facebook and Twitter?</p>\n<p><img class="lft" src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/adjustments-220-100.jpg" alt="Adjustments" /></p>\n<p>In adjustments, which offers everything from basic black and white to more advanced curves, most options come with a percentage scale that''s easy to adjust to find the right level of temperature, saturation, noise reduction, etc.</p>\n<p>It''s relatively easy to revert an edited photo back to its original form - unless you save an image. The reverse arrow icon in the top left corner of the screen lets users retrace their tracks if they find themselves in a no man''s land of shadows, highlights and inversions.</p>\n<p>Basic editing tools, adjustments, effects and image manipulation (warp, crops, fade, lens flare, etc.) are located across the top, while another set of tools stretches along the bottom and floats along the side when a user drags their finger up from the bottom right icon.</p>\n<p><img class="rght" src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/tools20along20bottom20of20pt-220-100.jpg" alt="tools on bottom" /></p>\n<p>While not lacking in tool options (all that contribute to a pretty legitimate editing experience), the app can be as frustrating as it is transformative. It''s still buggy, shutting down unexpectedly or taking longer than it should to save an image.</p>\n<p>Beyond the expected early-version technical glitches, Adobe has seemingly seen it unnecessary to include a thorough explanation of how to use the many tools that a beginner with only a cursory knowledge of Photoshop can easily get stuck on, or simply to maneuver around the app.</p>\n<p><img class="lft" src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/other20editing20tools-220-100.jpg" alt="Tools" /></p>\n<p>Most perplexing of all is a lack of thorough instructions. Whereas the tablet version of Photoshop Touch included tutorials and demos, Adobe cut down on these to seemingly save space on the phone. We can appreciate that, but we''d also appreciate having the minutes back we spent trying to figure out what to do after using the Scribble Selection tool (thankfully, there''s always Google).</p>\n<p>There''s a help section that gives users a basic understanding of how to start a project, work with layers and selections, share and save, and a basic rundown of tools. However, the tool tutorial doesn''t actually tell you which tools do what, but rather how to select a tool, zoom in and out, and hit undo and redo.</p>\n<p>For someone completely Photoshop ignorant, there''s a steep learning curve to understand what''s up with the Clone Stamp function, for example.</p>\n<p><img class="rght" src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/text-220-100.jpg" alt="Text" /></p>\n<p>That said, the app doesn''t lack for functions. Everyone from the occasional user to Photoshop addict should be pleased to see a wide assortment of tools literally at there finger tips.</p>\n<p>Experienced users will no doubt have a better time adjusting to the app than the first time Photoshopper, though after awhile selections become easier to return to and find.</p>\n<p>We experienced some fat finger mishaps to start, leading us to initially believe this app was an ill fated attempt to shrink the tablet version onto a smartphone.</p>\n<p>However, the more we used it, the more natural it all started to feel. Our first scribbled tries at Scribble Selection, which involves tracing the inner outline of an object in an image with a green line to keep it and edging around it with a red line to remove unwanted parts, reminded us of learning to color in the lines in kindergarten (which we failed miserably at, by the way).</p>\n<p><img class="lft" src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/scribble20select-220-100.jpg" alt="Scribble Select" /></p>\n<p>Yet with time came more finesse, and we could apply lines and extract image parts with relative ease (to select what you want to keep and chuck the rest, select the Extract button visible under the icon that''s a dotted square with a pen).</p>\n<p>After this step, you can supplant the image onto another background.</p>\n<p>Like a cool-toned photo, the app is pleasant on the eyes – some aspects of its layout are actually rather lovely and you feel like you are using a high-power editing tool.</p>\n<p>However, there were a number of bizarre sizing issues that were glaringly obvious on the small screen of a smartphone. There were times when an image we were trying to warp or crop to layer would take up about 30 percent of the space on the screen, leaving a slate gray border on most of the display. Trying to edit an image that small is next to impossible.</p>\n<p><img class="rght" src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/glasses-220-100.jpg" alt="glasses" /></p>\n<p>Finally, as sharing and mobile go hand-in-hand these days, there is of course the built-in ability to send your pictures to the greater world.</p>\n<p>From within the main gallery, a share icon at the bottom of the screen offers options to share via Google+, Facebook, Twitter and email.</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>Like driving a sports car with manual shifting for the first time, the more you time you spend with the Photoshop app, the more enjoyable it becomes.</p>\n<p>There''s a lot of learning as you go, which shouldn''t pose a problem for those familiar with the desktop and tablet versions. However, first time or starting out users might want to retreat to the comfort of Instagram and other easier to pick up photo editing apps before they get the full feel of PT.</p>\n<p>We did enjoy those "How did I get to this feature?" moments as it opened up doors to some interesting and unexpected editing aspects, but it also speaks to a lack of intuitiveness in the app. Again, those who''ve used the tablet version before should have an easier time getting from Point A to Point B on purpose. But, mobile users might find themselves somewhere they don''t want to be (or can''t get out of) more often than not.</p>\n<p>Is it worth $4.99? There are plenty of features that will get some good drive time, but it really just depends on how often you''ll use it.</p>\n<p>It''s not something we can see ourselves using every time we take a photo, but for those with creative inclinations and professionals who need a way to edit their work while on the go (projects are accessible through the Creative Cloud), you should get a lot of mileage out of this app.</p>\n<p>For the average consumer, it could easily serve as an introduction to the wider world of photo editing. Or, it could simply be a way to kill time on the train while creating a crafty photo for a family member or friend. Either way, you might be pleased with what you can come up with.</p>', '', 'flower20image-160-80.jpg', 'adjustments-220-100.jpg', NULL, 'Adobe has a Photoshop Touch app for mobile now, bringing full circle the devices that one can', 'Adobe has a Photoshop Touch app for mobile now, bringing full circle the devices that one can filter, crop, layer and manipulate images.This is version one of the Photoshop Touch app for', '29/07/2014', 1, 3),

The phone can even slow down the speech of the caller if you''re talking to someone who speaks particularly quickly.</p>\n<p>The phone also has a personal alarm built into it, which when activated can sound an audio alert as well as automatically contact up to three people to let them know you''re in trouble.</p>\n<p>In our brief test at MWC, we were really impressed.

The bottom bar has the three soft touch buttons you''ll find on every Windows Phone 8 handset - back, start and search - while the top bar holds the earpiece, the 0.3MP front-facing camera lens and Nokia''s logo.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/back-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 625"><figcaption>Colourful, but plastic</figcaption></figure></p><p>The back of the phone is incredibly plain as it''s dominated by the almost featureless polycarbonate cover.

The left edge has no buttons, ports or other features, and the top of the Lumia 625 merely has a 3.5mm headphone port.</p><p>In other words it''s a fairly plain handset through and through but that''s not necessarily a bad thing, as at least it avoids looking ugly, and if you''ve ever used a Lumia handset before you''ll be right at home here.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/side-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 625"><figcaption>Button positioning will be familiar to Lumia users</figcaption></figure></p><p>The back cover can easily be peeled off and underneath it you''ll find the micro SIM card slot and a micro SD card slot which supports cards of up to 64GB, allowing you to boost the storage way beyond the 8GB that''s built in.</p><p>You''ll also find the 2000 mAh battery hidden back here, which is substantially bigger than the 1300 mAh battery that the Lumia 620 ships with, however while the one in the 620 is removable this one isn''t.

It''s not initially apparent how to open the back cover, although once you do manage to work it out (by pulling around the MicroUSB jack), it becomes evident that the back cover isn''t as robust as it appears.</p>\n<p>Still, the cover is comfortable to hold and offers a decent grip, which is something lacking in many modern phones.</p>\n<p>Pop open the bonnet, and you''re confronted with those two full-size SIM card slots, with a MicroSD slot wedged between them.

There wasn''t any real lag or delay, with the phone switching between apps nice and quickly.</p>\n<p>The 8MP, meanwhile, still seems to struggle a bit in terms of clarity and definition. We haven''t been able to put it through its paces fully yet, but the few pics we did take in our initial play with the device all seemed a bit washed out and grainy.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/agora-quad-core5-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Kogan Agora quad-core smartphone review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The screen itself shows the biggest improvement over the previous generation.

HTC thinks the answer is to make it smaller, shave off a few unnecessary bits and make it a whole lot cheaper. </p><p>We''re excited about the prospect of the HTC One Mini, as it''s a handset with all the best bits of the  without as much of the cost. That''s got to be hitting a new segment of the market, right?</p><p>A look at the spec list, which admittedly isn''t the right way to weigh up a phone''s prowess, tells a different story, as it''s only coming with half the power of its bigger brother. The HTC One Mini has a dual core Snapdragon 400 processor, 1GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. The screen is a 4.3-inch option, running at 720p rather than the Full HD level of the original One.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1010944-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One Mini review"></figure></p><p>The reason we''ve got those elements out of the way early on is that they''re rather irrelevant to the review - the internal storage issue aside - as the HTC One Mini does what you''d hope it would. Namely, it makes the One more pocket-friendly, both literally and from a financial perspective.</p><p>It still uses BoomSound for amazing audio, the Ultrapixel camera is present and correct and even the underground hit, BlinkFeed, makes a welcome appearance to the mix. And that''s before we even get onto the design...</p><p>When it comes to making phones look and feel nice, HTC has long had decent credentials. It created something unsurpassable with the One, but with the One Mini it''s come up with a decent compromise that doesn''t make it feel like you''re getting a hand me down phone.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="6IQzdy10R926E"></div><p>The aluminium back is still present and correct, but is joined by a plastic rim, the same as sported by the HTC One X+. It diminishes the overall effect of the phone, but only slightly; we actually saw someone gasp when they picked up the One Mini, such was the effect of putting that aluminium chassis in the hand.</p><p>And that''s where HTC has nailed the design - the smoothness of the back is excellent, and makes you feel like you''re holding a really premium piece of kit. The plastic is almost invisible when you''re holding the phone normally, and the decreased weight (down to 122g from 149g) feels like the correct amount for the smaller screen.</p><p>The front facing speakers are smaller than the larger model, which makes sense of course, but they''re made of a more coarse metal, making it feel a little less finished and a little more industrial. It''s not a bad thing, but does make the One Mini look a little cheaper.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1010957-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One Mini review"></figure></p><p>The camera module is exactly the same as the main One, according to HTC, although it''s shorn of the optical image stabilisation that we''re seeing on top end handsets. In this case, it results in a smaller overall lens, which helps keep the One Mini so compact. The flash has been moved too, but this doesn''t seem to change the quality of the photos.</p><p>One element we do like over the larger model are the volume keys, as they''re now distinct options that make it easier to find and hit them when not looking directly at the phone (perhaps when on a call, or listening to music in the pocket). While on the HTC One Mini they feel a little wobbly and not as premium, we still prefer the layout to the single block on the One.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htconeminireview22-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One Mini review"></figure></p><p>Other than that, we''re massive fans of the design on the HTC One Mini. It''s a phone that just wants to be touched, with all the buttons in the right place. The screen, being 4.3-inch rather than the 4.8-inch option on the One, is a real boon to some people (namely, those that want to leave the iPhone 5 but don''t want a massive screen) and serves its purpose well.</p><p>With a 342ppi pixel density, that Super LCD2 screen (close to that seen in One in terms of technology, although that''s the slightly superior Super LCD3) is a great option that works very well in direct sunlight. It''s covered by Gorilla Glass 3, which saw nary a scratch during testing, and is the most crisp in its segment.</p><p>It certainly makes the  look underpowered and underspecified by comparison, and does well to come in at the same price point - in short, the screen on the HTC One Mini is a real stunner and should be a consideration point for anyone thinking about buying this phone.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1010956-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One Mini review"></figure></p><p>The price of the HTC One Mini is also pretty palatable: while the &pound;330-&pound;380 off contract price is a little steep, it still seems wholly fair for what you''re getting. Of course, we''d like to see all this packed into a &pound;100 device, but it''s not going to happen.

Or was it a case of too little, too late... and what about those darned Maps, eh?</p><ul><li></li><li></li></ul><h3>Design</h3><p>We''ll begin in the traditional manner: how the thing actually feels in the hand. With the iPhone 5 there will be many types of prospective buyer: the upgrader from the 4 (or more-money-than-sense iPhone 4S upgraders), those tired of their Android handset and those taking their first steps in the smartphone market and want to get one of them iThingies their friend/child has.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/iphone5review02-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPhone 5 review"></figure></p><p>Well, all of those picking up the iPhone 5 will have the same reaction: this thing is amazingly light. You''ve probably heard the numbers by now (20 per cent lighter than the predecessor, as well as beating most of the opposition too at 112g.)</p><p>It''s an odd sensation, but it actually detracts from the experience when you first pick it up. We''ve praised the weighty feel of the iPhone in the past, lending it a premium feel in the face of toy-like phones, and it''s almost disappointing that Apple decided to join that clan.</p><p>However, through extended use this problem quickly disappears. The overall effect of the phone is still a chassis designed for strength, and so it feels solid, if somehow a little hollow; pleasantly, though, it sits more anonymously in the pocket.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="XV05k66pM8d5M"></div><p>You''ll obviously see the change in height too &ndash; the iPhone 5 stands 123.8mm tall to allow for the larger 4-inch screen. In truth, those not familiar with the iPhone 4S probably wouldn''t notice the difference, which is why it''s a good move from Apple to include the larger screen if it''s not going put people off that hate larger phones.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/iphone5review04-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPhone 5 review"></figure></p><p>The decision to stick at 4-inches is Apple''s admission that while it recognises people are all over the idea of having more screen real estate to play with it doesn''t want to move away from the thumb-friendly nature of the device. </p><p>Through a mixture of moving the centre of gravity slightly as well as repositioning the screen within the bezel, it''s still possible to scroll your thumb mostly around the whole display one-handed, which Apple is clearly keen to keep hold of.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/iphone5review07-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPhone 5 review"></figure></p><p>However, we''re not convinced of that argument any more, and it''s the first iPhone where comfort to some extent really does depend on the size of your hands. For many people, it is possible to move a thumb around the entire display, albeit with a little more stretching than on previous models; anyone with smaller hands might find the top of the screen out of reach. For everyone, the Home button is harder to access when holding your phone comfortably.</p><p>The net result is a curious one: a device that''s more pleasant on the eyes and nicer to hold, but frequently more awkward to use than its predecessor. Newcomers might not notice that, but the compromise will be clear for upgraders from the iPhone 4S.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/iphone5review09-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPhone 5 review"></figure></p><p>The general construction of the iPhone 5 is excellent, to say the least. We''ve tested both the ceramic white version and the anodised black, and the two tone effect on the back of the phone is stunning, both visually and under the finger. </p><p>It doesn''t beat the sheer beauty of the , with its micro-arc oxidised back and rounded lines, but it''s well-set in second place.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/iphone5review11-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPhone 5 review"></figure></p><p>The two sections of pigmented glass at the top and the bottom of the phone add a pleasant effect, and the sapphire glass is meant to be thoroughly durable, to complement the Gorilla Glass on the front. </p><p>Apple knows consumers get furious when they drop and iPhone, and is clearly seeking to stop the smashes before they happen with a tougher exterior - although it seems the anodised black version is pretty prone to scratching, with a number of users mentioning chipping on the darker hue.</p><p>Phil Schiller, Apple''s Senior Vice President of Marketing, reportedly replied to an email from a user pointing out that aluminium will scratch and chip in natural use - and we''re also hearing that white iPhone 5 models are being returned through flaking as well.</p><p>We kept our black iPhone 5 in a soft pocket in a bag for much of its life, yet saw the following chip with minimal key / coin contact in under a fortnight:</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/iphone5chip-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPhone 5 chip"></figure></p><p>For a device of this premium quality, users will expect it to survive the pocket test, and especially do so for the first two weeks of life. It''s a big fail for Apple to expect users to accept that a product can be damaged so easily.</p><p>The same industrial band around the outside is in effect again as on the iPhone 4 and 4S, with small sections removed where the antenna joins. </p><p>Apple has gone for a more advanced form of antenna here, meaning the days of lost signal are gone, and generally increasing the power of your call connection and GPS lock on too.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/iphone5review12-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPhone 5 review"></figure></p><p>There are other big design changes here too: the headphone jack has moved to the bottom of the phone, and the iconic 30-pin connector has been retired in favour of the new Lightning port, giving a headache to all those that have invested in chargers, docks and other accessories over their iPhone lives. </p><p>You can buy an adaptor, but it''s pricey at &pound;25. And unless you want to keep it permanently attached to the bottom of the iPhone 5 you''ll need to buy a few, which is far from ideal.</p><p>However, let''s not harangue Apple too much for this: a smaller connector is not only easier to use (you can plug the smaller cable in either way round, and the connection feels more solid), but you''re rewarded with a thinner and more compact phone to boot.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/iphone5review08-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPhone 5 review"></figure></p><p>There''s also a small chink of light on the top right hand side of the iPhone 5 - when the screen is illuminated, you can see it under the band if you really, really look for it. It''s been seen by a number of users, but is hard to actually replicate unless you mask the screen and hold it at the right angle.</p><p>It''s again a sign of slightly under-par machining from Apple, but in day to day use it''s almost completely invisible.</p><p>The decision to move the 3.5mm headphone jack to the bottom is an odd one, as while it allows you to slip the phone into the pocket head-first when listening to music, which is a more natural action, it''s a real pain in the posterior for some apps that will only work in landscape a certain way up. </p><p>Using it this way means your headphones experience will be one of having to jiggle the jack around two fingers. </p><p>It''s not the most comfortable way to hold a phone, and even when using the phone in portrait mode, the jack gets in the way somewhat. Plus it''s miles away from the volume keys, which makes it hard to change the audio level in the pocket if you don''t use the dedicated headphones.</p><p>There are other smaller design changes to the iPhone 5 too, such as the iSight front-facing camera moving to the middle and the home button being noticeably more robust to help reduce instances of a broken portal to your home screen.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/iphone5review10-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPhone 5 review"></figure></p><p>But enough about what the phone looks like - the killer question is how the thing feels in the hand. And we''ll sum it up by saying: smooth. Some might find it a little slippery (we were always worried we would drop the darned thing), but unlike the glass-backed iPhone 4S, the iPhone 5''s unlikely to make a surprise trip off of a sofa and onto a wooden floor of its own accord.</p><p>So beyond the slightly odd form factor for those upgrading, and scratch issues for the black model, the design''s again extremely strong. For the most part, the iPhone remains a device suitable for use one-handed, although quibblers might grumble whether it''s quite as ultra-high spec as it should be - the lock button remains loose, so you can hear it clicking if you shake the phone. </p><p>That undoes some of the premium feel Apple''s going for, at least if you take to shaking a phone by your ear; more seriously, this device can have an up-front charge (off contract) of &pound;529-&pound;699, and so we''d argue it should be near perfection and free from noticeable (if admittedly small) blemishes.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/iphone5review05-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPhone 5 review"></figure></p><p>And while it looks nice, from the front it doesn''t really add much to the design of the iPhone - it''s certainly not the same as the jaw-dropping design of the iPhone 4 compared to the 3GS... it''s another evolution in the iLine. It''s not bad, but for those that hoped the iPhone 5 would be another step change there''s a good chance they''ll be disappointed about the look... until they feel the lovely back on offer.</p><p>There was a real chance here for Apple: remove the bezel and give the front of the screen a look that''s similar to the OLED TVs from the likes of Samsung or LG&hellip; but instead we''re treated to the same lines as before.</p><p>You always get the feeling that Apple saves what it can for the next iteration of the iPhone, and while there''s nothing wrong with the current construction we can see the edge-to-edge screen becoming something amazing on the iPhone 6 or iPhone 5S.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="uST651wdM1VK5"></div> ', '', 'iphone5review03-160-80.jpg', 'iphone5review09-580-100.jpg', NULL, 'The excitement of the rumour mill, the titillation of every leaked photo led to higher than ever', 'The excitement of the rumour mill, the titillation of every leaked photo led to higher than ever levels of expectation over the iPhone 5 features, and while the announcement was greeted with some', '', 1, 3);

But in reality it''s not actually too bad.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys4zoomreview01-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom review"></figure></p><p>Yes you might get a few stares when you start talking into what looks for all the world like a camera, but it''s not uncomfortable to hold either in landscape or portrait as your fingers can comfortably wrap around the camera lens and the protruding edge at the other side, so it''s no more awkward to use than any other phone.</p><p>Carrying it around in your pocket is slightly more of a problem, as thanks to the camera lens on the back it''s pretty bulky, coming in at 125.5 x 63.5 x 15.4mm.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys4zoomreview02-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom review"></figure></p><p>The length and width aren''t much greater than the similarly specced Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini, but the Mini is only 8.9mm thick. If you''ve got big pockets it''s not a problem, but skinny jeans might be a no-go.</p><p>Similarly the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom is quite weighty at 208g (around 7oz). That''s nearly double the weight of the Galaxy S4 Mini and quite a bit more than even the monstrous  - which comes in at 183g.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys4zoomreview04-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom review"></figure></p><p>It''s a noticeable weight too and not totally balanced as the side of the phone with the camera lens is disproportionately heavy, though not by much as the other side holds the battery. It''s not uncomfortable and nor is it heavy enough to weigh you down, but it is more than we''ve come to expect smartphones to weigh.</p><p>Aside from the fact that the Galaxy S4 Zoom doesn''t look much like a phone it''s a reasonably good looking device. The back of the phone is mostly glossy white plastic, with a large metallic 16 megapixel camera lens at one side featuring 10x optical zoom and optical image stabilisation. It can also shoot 1080p video at 30fps.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys4zoomreview06-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom review"></figure></p><p>There''s a protruding edge at the other side adorned with Samsung''s logo and jutting out as it does gives you something to grip, making it easy to get a firm hold of the handset. Between the lens and the edge there''s the Xenon flash, while at the far side of the lens there''s a speaker.</p><p>One issue with having the raised lens and grip on the back is that the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom is slightly unstable when screen up on a surface.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys4zoomreview07-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom review"></figure></p><p>It''s not going to go anywhere but it does sit at an angle and will rock up and down if you try and use it. On the plus side that sloped angle does give you a better view of the screen than if it were totally horizontal.</p><p>The front of the phone looks an awful lot like the front of the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini. It has a 4.3 inch 540 x 960 Super AMOLED display with a pixel density of 256 pixels per inch, which is identical to the display on the S4 Mini. Unfortunately it''s also not all that impressive, coming in at a sub full-HD resolution.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys4zoomreview08-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom review"></figure></p><p>The screen is encircled by a white border. Above the screen there''s a Samsung logo, while above that you''ll find the earpiece alongside a proximity and light sensor and the 1.9MP front facing camera.</p><p>Below the screen there''s a home button as well as a soft touch, light up button at either side of it- menu to the left and back to the right, but these can only be seen or used when the screen is on.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys4zoomreview11-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom review"></figure></p><p>The top of the handset (when held in portrait) has a 3.5mm headphone port at the right, a tiny microphone near the middle and an infrared port to the left.</p><p>There''s also a metallic rim that runs around the edge of the handset, making each edge half metallic and half glossy white plastic. It''s a nice contrast and gives the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom a premium look.</p><p>The bottom edge has a micro USB port in the centre - used for charging the phone or connecting it to a computer. It also has another little microphone to the right.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys4zoomreview05-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom review"></figure></p><p>You can also peel away a cover on the bottom edge to reveal the 2330mAh battery, which is removable, and the micro SIM card slot. It''s a neat and discreet location for both of those things, as it negates the need to remove the whole back cover while still making the battery accessible. The cover is easy to open too, but feels securely locked in place when closed.</p><p>The left edge of the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom features a little plastic cover at the bottom edge, which can be opened to reveal a microSD card slot with support for cards of up to 64GB. That''s something which is much needed given the paltry 8GB of built in storage.</p><p>The right edge of the handset features a dedicated camera button at the bottom. Having a dedicated camera button is no surprise given how much of a focus the camera is on this handset but it''s still much appreciated given that most Android handsets don''t have one.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsunggalaxys4zoomreview10-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom review"></figure></p><p>It''s in the optimal position too, as it''s where you''d expect to find one on a camera and doesn''t get in the way of either the screen or the lens when in use.</p><p>There''s a volume rocker near the middle and a power button- which also sleeps and wakes the handset, near the top. These buttons are all done up in the same silvery metallic style as the rim that runs around the phone, leaving them looking high quality.</p><p>All in all it''s a well built, solid handset that isn''t as awkward or uncomfortable to use as we''d expected. We''d go so far as to say that it actually looks pretty good - though we''d still take a conventional smartphone design over it from an aesthetic perspective.</p><p>By smartphone standards the camera is in a whole other league, but it still can''t match up to most decent compacts and the other specs aren''t much to write home about either, leaving the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom slightly compromised for a device with a &pound;440 (around $660, AU$720) price tag.</p> ', '', 'galaxys4zoom-press-02-160-80.jpg', 'samsunggalaxys4zoomreview02-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'The Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom is an unusual beast.

Thankfully, LG has placed all the standard buttons in familiar (unlike on the Huawei Ascend G510) and easy to hit places, with the power/lock button on the right hand side, with the volume rocker sat on the left, just below a customisable quick key (more on that later).</p><p>Just below the screen sit the almost traditional backlit soft keys, replacing the need for Android''s on screen controls.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dscf6229-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG Optimus L5 2 review"></figure></p><p>We only mention the backlighting as we found that its exclusion on the Ascend G510 meant that the buttons were a little hard to see. The back and menu key sit either side of a physical home button.</p><p>The home button has a nice LED light behind it, that illuminates whilst charging, during calls and alarms as well as for notifications and missed events.

Along with the LG logo, are the loud speaker, camera sensor and LED flash.</p><p>With the back cover wrapping around to the front of the L5 2, there is no set place with which to work the cover off.

And from the pictures, we weren''t alone in thinking it looked like a copy of the .</p><p>The difference is, when we took the Samsung model out of its box this time last year, we thought it was nice. When we took the Nexus 4 out of its box last week, we thought it was beautiful.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/odf5-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Google Nexus 4 review"></figure></p><p>Size wise, the Nexus 4 comes in at 133.9 x 68.7 x 9.1 mm &ndash; which means it is similar to its predecessor. But it is far more stunning to look at and hold.</p><p>The front is all glass in piano black. Extra tough too thanks to the Corning Gorilla Glass 2. Think  territory, but just a little nicer looking (we are aware that is a matter of opinion, iFans!) </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nexus4-handson-17-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Google Nexus 4 review"></figure></p><p>The whole front is set within a dull chrome bezel and the shininess even extends to the rear of the handset, which has an attractive, though unusual sparkly pattern adorning it - although newer shipments seem to be shorn of that element now.</p><p>Think the glittery kind of jacket that you could see Cilla Black, Joan Rivers or Shirley Bassey in at an awards ceremony, and you catch our drift. </p><p>Since launch LG has updated the design very slightly on the rear of the Nexus 4, with newer handsets sporting two tiny bumps at the bottom of the phone, which elevates the handset slightly.</p><p>This means sound isn''t as distorted when played through the rear speaker, plus it stops the shiny glass back of the Nexus 4 scratching on the surface it''s sitting on.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nexus4-handson-20-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Google Nexus 4 review"></figure></p><p>At 139g, the Nexus 4 isn''t the lightest handset in school &ndash; but it''s just about solid enough to get away with carrying that extra weight and puts those who say Android devices look like toys firmly in their place.</p><p>The screen is invisible when off &ndash; but when it lights up, you''re treated to 4.7-inches of True HD IPS Plus beauty. That''s 768 x 1280 pixels with a pixel density of 318. It is razor sharp &ndash; blowing Retina out of the water and we''ll venture it is one of the best we''ve seen on a handset. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nexus4-handson-12-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Google Nexus 4 review"></figure></p><p>Another reason for this is because there is such little space between the glass and the display. So where we berated the Optimus 4X HD for leaving enough room here to park a small car, the Nexus 4 leaves no gap at all. </p><p>It exudes a clarity that has to be seen to be believed. Colours look beautiful, icons and text are razor sharp and everything floats perfectly.</p><p>We find it hard to see how this could be beaten. When you''re looking at icons on a black background (like in the app drawer), you can''t even see the black, if that makes sense. It is so deep, that icons just float. Beneath the screen, in the centre, but hidden until needed, lies a pulsating notification light.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/odf6-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Google Nexus 4 review"></figure></p><p>Another element worth pointing out here is the way the phone curves at the sides, from the main panel into the bezel. It seems to make the screen look even more realistic and beautiful. It''s one of those things you really have to experience to appreciate.</p><p>Round the edges, you''ll find the usual adornments. A 3.5mm headphone jack on top, volume rocker and micro SIM tray on the left, micro USB port plus a few dubious screws on the bottom, and a perfectly placed lock/unlock/power button on the upper right hand side.</p><p>It''s just in that sweet spot where it''s easy to press with the thumb if you''re right handed and not impossible if you''re a leftie.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/odf7-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Google Nexus 4 review"></figure></p><p>There''s no way of getting the back off &ndash; so you know what that means, peeps. No removable battery and no expandable storage. The former doesn''t faze us too much since the 2,100mAh battery pack is no slouch but the lack of memory card allowance is annoying. </p><p>Yes, we know that ever since the , expandable memory is out. Google''s said that it doesn''t offer it because it''s confusing. But for those with lots of content who can''t or don''t want to stream, it''s a real pain. We don''t quite buy Google''s argument.</p><p>As for the innards, LG has cut no corners here. Make no mistake, this is a premium handset. DC-HSDPA, the very latest iteration of , a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset, quad-core 1.5GHz processor, A-GPS with GLONASS,  and so forth.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/odf8-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Google Nexus 4 review"></figure></p><p>But what makes this so sweet is the price. Let''s just point out that sim-free, a  with similar specs will set you back around &pound;320 (around $490/AU$475) and the  can now be snapped up for &pound;329 (around $525/AU$503).</p><p>And while last year''s Galaxy Nexus will leave your wallet &pound;299 (around $477/AU$458) lighter, this brand new model, the Nexus 4 is priced &ndash; almost unbelievably &ndash; at &pound;239 ($299/AU$349) for the 8GB version and &pound;279 ($349/AU$480) for 16GB. Yes, the newer Nexus is cheaper than the year old Nexus. Word!</p><p>We can''t overestimate just how revolutionary this is and it leaves us open-mouthed at how Google is doing this. Either it''s  &ndash; or the mark-up on handsets is now shown up as being ridiculously high. Whichever it is, it means the Nexus 4 has a distinct advantage over the competition.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nexus4-handson-10-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Google Nexus 4 review"></figure></p><p>Bizarrely, in the UK Google promised O2 that it can sell the Nexus 4 as an exclusive for the first month. We can''t understand why &ndash; especially because you could end up paying &pound;800 for the device over the course of the contract, but there are loads of these all over Google Play Store these days.</p><p>Virgin Mobile has also joined the Nexus 4 brigade by offering LG''s handset on a contract - but with prices starting at &pound;31 a month, it''s not going to be a decent way to get a cheap Google phone in your hand.</p><p>Most people with sense (and a bit of spare cash) will buy the Nexus SIM-free and get themselves a cheap as chips SIM-only plan.

The phone is actually formed of two "halves", with an interchangeable backplate.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dscn0071-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Jolla" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>It''s not just about making your Jolla Phone look nicer though. The backplates also include NFC, which will cause the OS to morph depending on what you attach. We were shown an Angry Birds backplate that gave the UI a unique touch of the avian variety, while another changed the colour themes of the Jolla''s unique OS.</p>\n<p>That OS is Sailfish, a Linux-based system inspired by MeeGo. With Sailfish, Jolla wanted to create an OS that was perfect for one-hand operation, and indeed there are no buttons - not even capacitive - to be found on the handset.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dscn0124-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Jolla" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>That''s because Jolla wants your thumb to become the home button, each swipe a different function depending on its direction.</p>\n<p>Swipe from left to right and the app you''re currently in will be minimised and you''ll be greeted with a grid of other apps that are currently open. This lets you easily jump from one app to another, or delete any you''re no longer using.</p>\n<p>Swipe from bottom to top and you''ll be met with your list of notifications. You can also wake the phone up from sleep by double tapping anywhere on the screen, which is a particularly nice legacy feature from the Nokia N9.</p>\n<p>Sailfish is really nice to look at too, with those tear-shaped icons sitting beautifully within the colourful UI.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dscn0080-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Jolla" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>When it clicks, there''s a nice fluidity to it. But it''s a system that takes some getting used to, especially for thumbs used to dancing around Android, which will find Sailfish a little unintuitive at first.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dscn0063-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Jolla" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Which brings us to, well, Android. Jolla has designed Sailfish to be open, and while you can download apps from Jolla''s own store, there''s not enough here to satisfy. Thankfully, Sailfish can also run Android apps.</p>\n<p>To get them, you''ll need to install a third-party Android store - the one we tried during our play time was Yandex.</p>\n<p>When those apps are running, you''ll get back the Android back button and multi-tasking nav button as well. It''s a work in progress, and we found that Android apps were a bit unstable at times. A couple of nasty crashes did take place.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dscn0148-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Jolla" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Jolla is also in the process of making Sailfish OS available for Android-running hardware. It''s a work in progress, which requires a lot of optimising for different devices, but we got to try it out on a few different third-party phones and the experience was just like on the Jolla phone, though a little more buggy.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dscn0134-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Jolla" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>It''s difficult to recommend the Jolla Phone this early in the game.

By focusing on a severe, almost industrial, sharp-cornered black slab design it managed to stand out from the crowd of me-too iPhone copies and sculpted plastic efforts.</p><p>The Sony Xperia M makes a cursory nod to that immediate heritage, but it''s hardly a looker. Sony has once again gone with a somewhat anonymous blank-faced design with an all-glass (or mostly glass) front, with a slightly gaudy (but useful) notification strip-light hidden immediately below the screen. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/xperiam-handson-11-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia M"><figcaption>Smaller than many Android phones</figcaption></figure></p><p>The sides and rear of the device are all one plastic component. This can be peeled off via a neat access point built into the ridge of the microUSB port on the upper left hand side. Exposing the Xperia M''s innards provides access to its battery, as well as the SIM and microSD slots. </p><p>Though this approach is commendably tidy, I almost wish the microSD slot had been made accessible from the outside, as the Xperia M suffers from a cripplingly small amount of internal storage - a frankly pathetic 4GB, which works out to just 2GB of usable space once the OS has had its portion.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/microsd-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia M"><figcaption>The microSD slot is internal</figcaption></figure></p><p>If you have anything less than a 16GB card, I fear you''ll be reaching capacity quickly.</p><p>Back to external matters, and by making its rear cover encompass so much of the phone, the Xperia M feels pleasantly solid. Turn it over, and the matte finish and blunted corners of the rear panel put us in mind of the recent Nokia Lumia range.</p><p>Those silver plastic edge strips just look plain tacky, though, and the tapered shiny plastic front panel surround reminds us of HTC''s designs from four years ago.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/xperiam-handson-06-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia M"></figure></p><p>Sony''s ideas about control layout continue in the entry-level Xperia M - that is, keep the front section completely free of physical buttons and plonk some contrastingly chunky examples together on the side. </p><p>I quite like this approach. It means that you never have to take your attention away from the screen to press a button, even when you have to interact with one of the virtual controls that takes up a thin band of the display.</p><p>Yes, Sony is one of startlingly few manufacturers to adopt Google''s own virtual control set-up, but we''ll discuss that more a little later.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/xperiam-handson-05-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia M"></figure></p><p>The side-mounted physical controls do the job far better than most rival offerings.

The Galaxy Mega unsurprisingly then, sits a little awkwardly in one hand, although the narrow depth and lighter weight make it a lot easier than we first expected. The Galaxy Mega even sits rather comfortably in the pocket, providing you''re not wearing anything that fits a little tight.</p>\n<p>Design wise, the Mega sits well within the existing Galaxy range, with the thinner bezel and curved edges giving it a clean look, and Samsung''s standard button lay out giving an air of familiarity.

We appreciate that Sony might have been going for symmetry, but with the lack of any front-facing buttons, and the curved chassis, the bezel feels a little chunky.</p><p>For external buttons, the Xperia L has a round lock/power key sat about half way up the left side, sat below the volume rocker.

Our colleague Kate will be pleased to find that the headphone port is at the top of the Xperia L, sat neatly in the centre.

But it seems like a missed opportunity to compete on a level playing field against the wider phone world.</p><p>At first sight you might almost not recognise the Lumia 925 as a Nokia handset. It has the same sharply rectangular shape that the Nokia Lumia 920 has, but where that was all brightly coloured plastic, the Nokia Lumia 925 has a shiny aluminium band running around the sides. It gives it a premium edge that is sorely lacking from other Nokia handsets, and it looks good for it.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/pr20shot6-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 925 review"></figure></p><p>Unfortunately Nokia hasn''t gone the whole hog and made a completely metal handset like the , and instead made the back from polycarbonate. It still looks decent and the fairly conservative colour options (black, white or silver) mean that it looks a lot classier and more grown up than the Nokia Lumia 920, but it doesn''t come close to the premium look or feel of the HTC One.</p><p>Despite incorporating metal into its design, the Nokia Lumia 925 is actually lighter than the Nokia Lumia 920, coming in at 139g (4.9oz) compared to the 185g (6.5oz) Lumia 920. The weight was one of our key qualms with the Nokia Lumia 920, so it''s good to see that it''s been addressed. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nokialumia925review12-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 925 review"></figure></p><p>At a sleek 8.5mm (0.33 inches), the Nokia Lumia 925 is quite a bit thinner than its 10.7mm (0.42-inch) predecessor too, while the length and width remain almost identical at 129 x 70.6mm (5.08 x 2.78 inches).</p><p>It feels nice in the hand and it''s generally quite comfortable to hold, though there are a couple of caveats to that. Firstly the position of the camera lens on the back makes it very easy to accidentally put your fingers over it, which is uncomfortable and could leave marks on the lens. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nokialumia925review37-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 925 review"></figure></p><p>And secondly, the corners aren''t very curved, which means they can dig into your hand if you hold the phone in a certain way. On the plus side, the polycarbonate back feels soft and warm against your palm, which is a comforting sensation.</p><p>The front of the Nokia Lumia 925 is dominated by the 4.5 inch 768 x 1280 AMOLED screen. It''s not quite edge to edge but it''s not far off at the sides - although there''s reams of plastic above and below, which seems a trifle unnecessary. It''s a good size too in our opinion, big enough to use easily without becoming unwieldy. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nokialumia925review41-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 925 review"></figure></p><p>At 332 pixels per inch it also has a pretty good pixel density, though not one that will bother the HTC One or Samsung Galaxy S4. And in fact it''s exactly the same size and resolution as the previous model, which is a little disappointing. However it does use the same impressive PureMotion HD+ ClearBlack technology as the Nokia Lumia 920.</p><p>Above the screen there''s Nokia''s logo, the earpiece and the 1.3 MP front-facing camera, while below the screen there are three soft touch buttons with icons for Start, Back and Search.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nokialumia925review22-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 925 review"></figure></p><p>Flip the Nokia Lumia 925 over and you''ll find another Nokia logo stamped across the middle of the polycarbonate back, while above that there''s an 8.7MP Carl Zeiss camera lens and flash, and near the bottom of the handset there''s a speaker.</p><p>The plastic around the lens is raised, leaving the lens itself slightly indented. That gives it a little protection when putting the phone down, but it also makes the phone less comfortable to hold as your fingers will often stray over the raised area.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nokialumia925review39-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 925 review"></figure></p><p>The left edge of the phone consists of a strip of metal with no real features on it, while the right edge has the power button in the middle, a volume rocker just above it and the camera button near the bottom. The buttons are all quite raised and responsive, making them easy to press and easy to find by touch alone. They''re also spaced out enough that there''s no confusion over which is which.</p><p>The top of the Nokia Lumia 925 houses the micro SIM card slot at the left, the micro USB port and 3.5mm headphone port near the centre and the microphone to the right.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/pr20shot2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 925 review"></figure></p><p>The bottom edge is left unadorned, with just the metal band running along it.</p><p>You can''t remove the back cover so there''s no getting to the Nokia Lumia 920-matching 2000mAh battery and there''s also no microSD card slot, so unlike some lower-end Nokia handsets (such as the ), the storage isn''t expandable.

With two of the strongest full-sized tablets around as its main competitors, the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet really needs to step up its game.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyxperiaz2tablet201-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 tablet review"><figcaption>The waterproof features are more for peace of mind than day to day use.</figcaption></figure></p><p>Interestingly, the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet faces pressure from these rivals in different ways. The iPad Air challenges it for desirability and premium feel, while the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 competes more directly on raw specs and numerous software features.</p><p>Sony has won a couple of these battles, but perhaps not as many as it would have hoped for.</p><p>Sony hasn''t messed with the basic design of the Sony Xperia Tablet Z here, and that''s just fine by us. Now in a slightly slimmer, lighter shell, we have no compunction with calling the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet the best-looking Android tablet on the market.</p><p>You can spot a modern Sony smart device from a mile off. They tend to be a lot squarer than rival offerings, with sharp corners and uniform, parallel surfaces. The Xperia Z2 Tablet sticks to this template.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyxperiaz2tablet2011-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 tablet review"><figcaption>A simple design</figcaption></figure></p><p>From the front, the Xperia Z2 Tablet looks quite chunky, thanks to its thick screen bezel, which perversely makes the screen seem smaller.</p><p>With the left and right sides (in landscape, the Z2 Tablet''s default orientation) especially pronounced, its lack of fascia buttons, and Sony''s subtle branding in the top left hand corner, it almost looks like a tiny Bravia TV. </p><p>One telltale sign that it isn''t is the white matte plastic edging that extends from the rear of the device and creeps around to meet the surface glass. This unique frame, which contains strips of flat silver plastic along the length of each edge, is another trademark of the current Xperia range.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/xperiaz2tablet-handson-01-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet review"><figcaption>A larger bezel, apparently designed for easier grip, feels antiquated</figcaption></figure></p><p>I found that this plastic edging was susceptible to marking. A relatively light contact with my MacBook when carrying both together left an unusual dink running across both white and silver plastic sections - something you feel probably would not have happened with a Samsung tablet, and certainly not with an iPad.</p><p>Close examination reveals these materials to be a little flimsy, then, but the overall effect is a pleasing one. There''s a hard-to-define sense of quality that Sony manages to imbue in its plastic devices that Samsung (for example) doesn''t always manage.</p><p>It''s all the more impressive given just how slim the device is. At just 6.4mm, it''s half a centimetre thinner than its predecessor, and more than a millimetre thinner than the iPad Air.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1070176-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet review"><figcaption>The Z2 Tablet is even thinner than the Air</figcaption></figure></p><p>The Xperia Z2 Tablet is also surprisingly light. With a weight of just 426g, it''s almost 70g lighter than the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and some 43g lighter than the iPad Air.</p><p>Sure, you can cause the device to bend and flex if you apply some pressure, but when simply sat in your hands normally it feels great.</p><p>The only physical buttons here are the power and volume keys, and they''re well situated mid-way up the left-hand side. It sounds like a silly thing to say, but Sony makes the best power buttons in the business. The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet''s is predictably round, pronounced and moreishly clicky, and it''s very easy to feel out in a darkened room.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyxperiaz2tablet207-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet review"><figcaption>The Omnibalance design is great for hardware</figcaption></figure></p><p>Its nubbin design is a great reference point in such situations - you locate the power button, then slide your finger down a centimetre to the flatter volume rocker. Simple.</p><p>The tablet''s main camera lens is placed right in the top left corner. In other, bulkier tablets this can lead to some irritating finger-in-shot moments, but thanks to the Xperia Z2 Tablet''s slight build, I never found this to be a problem here.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet''s edges are unusually featureless. Other than the 3.5mm jack on the bottom left (which can be awkward if you want to prop up the tablet on a table with a set of headphones plugged in), and the slightest of ingresses for the charging dock connector (sold separately) to the right, it''s all pretty much flush.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyxperiaz2tablet209-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet review"><figcaption>A well-placed camera</figcaption></figure></p><p>There''s an infra-red emitter on the top alongside a tiny mic, but it still feels like something''s missing.</p><p>That''s because to the left of the infrared sensor you''ll find two chunky covers concealing the microUSB and microSD slots. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyxperiaz2tablet2013-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet review"><figcaption>The unattractive covers</figcaption></figure></p><p>This helps with Xperia Z2 Tablet''s tidy looks, but it can be a little irritating when you''re scrabbling around to put it on charge - especially when you have the tablet''s software warning you every time a port is opened.</p><p>Of course, there''s an important reason behind these covers, which we''ll discuss in the next section.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="e8lw4cZNQ2ZSO"></div> ', '', 'sonyxperiaz2tablet205-160-80.jpg', 'p1070176-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'It''s become a bit of a cliche, but a year really is a long time in technology.

In fact, it''s strange to call it 8.1 when it could really warrant a whole new name. </p><p>Many of the issues that we''ve always had with Windows Phone have finally been addressed, for the most part, and it makes the platform slightly more pleasurable to use. Things that had given us headaches, like the lack of a better notification system, are all gone. </p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/wp8-1-580-100.jpg" alt="Windows Phone 8.1 review"></p><p>Of course, it''s still very much Windows Phone. So for those of you already familiar with previous iterations of Windows Phone, you''ll feel right at home with some pleasant surprises along the way. </p><p>Live Tiles, the Metro UI and everything else remains mostly the same, but with tweaks here and there that improve the overall experience. Perhaps the biggest addition to Windows Phone 8.1 is Cortana, Microsoft''s voice-recognition personal assistant.</p><p>With Cortana, Windows Phone finally joins iOS and Android in having a personal assistant, so to speak. Like its competitors, Cortana responds to all kinds of commands and requests, from the very basic things like setting alarms to more advanced stuff, like asking if a nearby restaurant is any good.</p><p>Another new feature is the notification pane, called Action center, which is just like the ones on iOS and Android. We can''t thank the stars enough for this, especially since the previous system, Toast notifications, were just awful.</p><p>When you pull down from the top bar, a window pane comes down with toggle switches for things like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, along with a list of all your pending notifications. You''ll also have the option to jump into settings or clear all notifications from this pane. Thank heaven. Seriously.</p><p>With that quick intro out of the way, let''s dive a little deeper into this new stuff and see what the fuss is all about. But before we proceed, it''s important to note that we have a developer preview version of Windows Phone 8.1, meaning that a lot of things could change before the final software version reaches the masses.</p><h3>Cortana</h3><p>With Cortana, you should be able to do all kinds of things without having to press more than a single button. First, like a good personal assistant should, Cortana learns important tidbits about you and who you are and things you''re into. </p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/cortana-1-580-100.jpg" alt="Windows Phone 8.1 review"></p><p>Keeping track of your habits, interests and daily activities better helps Cortana guide you through things and make suggestions. It probably also helps Microsoft gather way more data about you, even though the company promises the info won''t be used to advertise to you.</p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/wp8-4-580-100.jpg" alt="Windows Phone 8.1 review"></p><p>You''ll get suggestions and reminders when you set them, or when you''re interested in taking a look, and you can also schedule things in your calendar and send messages, too. </p><p>When you open up the app, the first thing you''ll see is the weather and other items that might be pertinent to you, like transportation times, and more. Your information is kept in Cortana''s Notebook, which holds your interests, quiet hours, places you visit, music searches you make and more.</p><p>Based on your interests compiled in Cortana''s Notebook, you''ll get information that suits you, rather than random suggestions that might have no interest to you. It''s a little like Google Now, which shows you your travel data, calendar updates and more. </p><p>In the Interests section, you can quickly glance at your day by checking traffic, weather, news headlines and more. You can also get suggestions on what to eat nearby, plan trips and check for local attractions. </p><p>One neat feature in Cortana is quiet hours, and it works much like iOS''s Do Not Disturb feature. You can set certain times of the day when you won''t be bothered with notifications and calls. However, there is an option to let callers get through if they call a number of times within a given time frame, which makes it likely an emergency. Although, I did have a drunk ex once who''d call me repeatedly and bypass iOS''s Do Not Disturb, so I just had to shut off that feature altogether. Your mileage may vary.</p><p>An additional option in quiet hours, like other OSes, is making exceptions for certain contacts. If you add people to your "inner circle" they can bypass the quiet hours entirely. This would be useful if you need to answer your boss''s phone calls at 1 a.m., for example.</p><p>Cortana also works with speech to text, so you can just talk instead of typing when you need to. Like iOS and Android, all you do is tap the microphone button and start talking to your phone. Once you''re done speaking, the phone will recognize when you''re finished and the text just pops right up where it should be. Easy.</p><p>No virtual assistant is perfect, and Cortana isn''t immune to the same faults as Siri or Google Now. </p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/wp8-5-580-100.jpg" alt="Windows Phone 8.1 review"></p><p>Occasionally, Cortana has some trouble hearing or deciphering things, so you''ll just have to do a few things manually when that''s the case. And if you ask Cortana for something that it doesn''t understand, it will default you to a Bing web search, just like Siri would. Straight to the web.</p><p>We''d expect Cortana to get much better over time, and it''s definitely a welcome addition to Windows Phone.

There is no doubt that the phone feels a little heavy at first, especially when compared to the almost impossibly light Galaxy S4 Mini, but this feeling disappears as quickly as it is noticed.</p><p>The smaller frame made using the Xperia Z1 Compact easy to use one handed, and didn''t suffer the same problems of grip that beset the original Xperia Z1.

First off, the Nokia Lumia 520 doesn''t have . It also doesn''t have a camera flash or a front-facing camera, plus there''s no compass built into it. And while the screen is slightly bigger, it still has the same resolution, resulting in a marginally lower ppi.</p><p>But we don''t consider any of them to be deal breakers, and depending on how you plan to use the phone they may well be things you can happily live with - especially for &pound;70.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>Like all recent Nokia handsets there''s a lot of colour in the Nokia Lumia 520. It shares the look of other Lumia devices, with a single piece of smooth plastic covering the back and sides of the phone.</p><p>That shell is available in black or white, but the bright shades of yellow, blue and red on offer will appeal if you like it loud.</p><p>If nothing else, it makes Nokia handsets stand out from the crowd. Regardless of the colour, it''s quite a nice looking phone in other ways, with an angular, rectangular design more in line with the higher end Nokia Lumia 920 than the curved edges of its closest relations &ndash; the Nokia Lumia 620 and 625.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/back201-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 520 review"></figure></p><p>It''s certainly a more distinctive (and I''d argue classier) look than that of the Lumia 620 &ndash; which is odd considering the Lumia 520 is supposed to be the more basic option.</p><p>It''s also slimmer and lighter than the Lumia 620, at a fairly sleek 9.9mm and 124g. At 119.9x64mm it is longer and wider than the Lumia 620, but that''s understandable given that it''s also got a slightly bigger screen.</p><p>I like the feel of it too. The plastic casing seems almost warm, making it nice to hold, and it''s not as slippery as it might look &ndash; so getting a firm grip on the handset is no problem.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/front-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 520 review"></figure></p><p>The almost jagged corners can dig into your hand a little when held in certain positions, but it''s at worst slightly uncomfortable and easily avoided by adjusting your grip.</p><p>The front of the Nokia Lumia 520 is mostly screen as you''d expect and at 4-inches it''s a decent size for a low-price handset. The pixel density of 233 pixels per inch also isn''t bad at all for the money you''re paying. Sure, it''s dwarfed by the likes of the 469ppi , but it''s also many times cheaper.</p><p>A huge plus is the ability to use gloves with the screen too &ndash; being able to type in the cold weather is becoming a really common ability on phones, but I''m impressed Nokia managed it on such a cheap handset.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/top203-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 520 review"></figure></p><p>Unlike some handsets, the screen here isn''t edge-to-edge: there''s a black border running the entire way around it. At the sides this border is fairly narrow, but it becomes quite wide at the top to make room for the earpiece and a Nokia logo. It''s even wider at the bottom, because that''s where you''ll find the start, back and search softkeys.</p><p>The back of the handset is almost featureless, with just a small Nokia logo in the centre, the 5MP camera lens near the top and a tiny loudspeaker near the bottom.</p><p>The right edge of the handset houses all of the phone''s physical buttons, with a volume rocker at the top, a power button near the middle and a camera button near the bottom. The layout works well, with the buttons spaced far enough to prevent confusion.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/inside202-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 520 review"></figure></p><p>The left edge is devoid of any features, ports or buttons at all.

It seems so obvious." And while it does seem like an obvious thing to make a battery pack that also offers more storage, pulling it off easily is the tricky part, and Mophie nails it, more or less.</p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/mophie-11-580-100.jpg" alt="Mophie Space Pack review"></p><p>If you''re already familiar with Mophie''s iPhone cases, you''ll feel right at home with the Space Pack. In fact, it''s nothing more than a new Juice Pack Air with additional storage. You slide your iPhone 5/5S into the Space Pack, and the rear on/off switch does the rest.</p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/mophie-8-580-100.jpg" alt="Mophie Space Pack review"></p><p>There is also a silver indicator button on the rear, which was black in previous Juice Pack models, that shows you how much battery life the case itself has remaining.</p><h3>Mophie Space Pack: Sweet iPhone juice and storage</h3><p>With a capacity of 1,700 mAh on the Space Pack, you''re doubling your iPhone 5/5S'' battery life. Moreover, you''ll get an additional 16GB or 32GB of storage depending on which model you buy. They are priced at $150 and $180, respectively.</p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/mophie-2-580-100.jpg" alt="Mophie Space Pack review"></p><p>The only learning curve you''ll have here is the few moments it takes to familiarize yourself with Mophie''s Space app. It''s available for free in the iTunes App Store, and it''s what allows you to take advantage of the additional storage that the Mophie Space Pack offers.</p><p>You''ll see that the app''s design is very much in line with elements in iOS 7. It''s also intuitive to use, so you can figure out what''s going on just by playing around in the app.</p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/mophie-13-580-100.jpg" alt="Mophie Space Pack review"></p><p>Adding videos, music, documents and other times of media to the Space Pack is easy with the app. All of your media and documents are neatly organized, too. </p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/mophie-5-580-100.jpg" alt="Mophie Space Pack review"></p><p>What''s also great about the Space Pack is that you don''t have to do all your organizing and interfacing with it on your iPhone 5/5S. You''ll be able to plug the Space Pack into your computer to add, remove, sync and organize data, as well as giving it a light charge while you do so. If you want to add more songs, for example, you just do so via the computer. When you slide your iPhone 5/5S back into the Space Pack, you''ll be able to access those files.</p><h3>Verdict</h3><p>If you''re looking for more juice for your iPhone 5/5S, and you don''t mind having in the form of a case, you''d better go with the Mophie Space Pack for that sweet, sweet storage. Unlike other smartphones that have microSD card slots, the iPhone doesn''t have expandable storage, so the Mophie Space Pack is the next best thing.</p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/mophie-15-580-100.jpg" alt="Mophie Space Pack review"></p><p>All day battery life, sometimes two days, plus more than enough storage than you could need is a dream for the iPhone 5/5S.

Really, really nice.''</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htconereview01-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One review"></figure></p><p>And do you know why? Simple: the HTC One is one of the best-designed phones on the planet. Not content with inventing a new machining process to allow the body to be all aluminium, the Taiwanese firm has extended the screen to the edges of the chassis further than ever before, meaning you''re getting a 4.7-inch Full HD display without the additional heft you''d probably expect.</p><p>It''s even thinner than its predecessor, the HTC One X (we know, that naming strategy leaves a lot to be desired) and as such slides nicely in the pocket. </p><p>It''s not light either, weighing more than most of the competition, but rather than feeling overweight, combined with the metallic chassis is oozes a premium build. Samsung is probably hoping not a lot of people hold this phone side-by-side with the Galaxy  as otherwise the buying choice is going to be a lot more of a worry for the Koreans.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htconereviewnature07-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One review"></figure></p><p>On top of that, there''s a whole host of little design wins that delight when you first try the HTC One. For instance, the machined holes that allow sound toe emanate from the dual front-facing speakers (can you say BOOMSOUND?) looks amazing, and the lines on the back of the phone give a nice textured movement to things, helping to break up the constant greyness of the aluminium.</p><p>You could argue that straight on it looks far too much like either an iPhone 5, with its chamfered edges, or a BlackBerry Z10 front on, and you''d have a good point as this phone doesn''t reinvent the rectangle-with-rounded-edges formula that we''re so used to, but in the hand the curved back brings a whole new dimension to things.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htconereviewnature03-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One review"></figure></p><p>There''s a zero-gap construction at work here as well, which means that you won''t find any gaping distance, holes or light leakages to make you feel like you''ve not spent your hard-earned cash on something wonderful. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htconereviewnature10-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One review"></figure></p><p>The volume control on the right-hand side of the phone is in the same dazzling metal, and contrasts nicely with the rubber/plastic that makes up the sides. Our sample actually showed a fair amount of wiggle in this area, and slightly detracted from the overall premium feel. However, later models have deleted this problem, so chances are you won''t notice it either.</p><p>The power button resides on the top, and doubles as the infra-red blaster - however, this is one of the poorer points as it doesn''t have a whole lot of travel.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htconereview04-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One review"></figure></p><p>Similarly, the placement of this button, even on a phone that''s been shrunk down while accommodating a larger screen, is still a bit inconvenient. We had to shuffle the phone around in the palm to turn it on and off on many occasions, and a lot of the time we couldn''t use our thumb to hit the whole of the screen without jiggling the phone up and down.</p><p>That''s another problem with the design: it''s pretty slippery thanks to the metallic chassis. We thankfully only ever suffered two serious drops when we were about a foot off the carpet (basically scrabbling for it to turn off the alarm in the morning) and a more alarming one stepping out of a cab, but there have been a few near misses when trying to manoeuvre around the screen. </p><p>If only that power button was on the side (as it is on the ), or a physical home button unlocked the phone, this whole issue would be negated for a large part.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htconereview25-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One review"></figure></p><p>But as we mentioned, HTC has wandered away from the physical buttons - where once it put a trackpad in the Nexus One, now it''s stripped the capacitive buttons down from three to two, with the multi-tasking option going the way of the dodo. You can still get the same functionality by double tapping the home button, but it''s not the same.</p><p>Overall though, you can guess we''re impressed with the construction and design of the HTC One. We''re not even looking at final hardware here - although we appear to have got lucky with our sample, as there are few design flaws in sight - so the chances of metallic chipping (''because that''s just what it does....'' OK, Apple) are slight to say the least - providing you don''t fling it on tarmac.

And one thing Nokia phones rarely have is merely ordinary cameras.</p><p>The result is a phone that fails to excite or wholly convince, but which arguably feels more comfortable with the Windows Phone 8 OS than its brash brother.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/front20hold-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Holding"></figure></p><p>You thought that the Nokia Lumia 1520 was big? The Nokia Lumia 1320 is even bigger.</p><p>At 164.6mm tall, it''s roughly 5mm longer, while it''s more than a millimetre thicker at 9.79mm. You''d better reinforce those pockets, because the Nokia Lumia 1320 weighs a hefty 220g &ndash; 11g more than its heavyweight sibling.</p><p>It somehow feels less imposing than the 1520, however. Nokia has filed off the sharp corners and gone with more traditional design, while my test model''s plain-black colour scheme doesn''t exactly demand your full attention.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/back-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Back"></figure></p><p>Unlike the 1520, the Nokia Lumia 1320 comes with a removable back section, which folds right around the side of the device and meets up with the all-glass front.</p><p>This makes for a generally solid-feeling device, aided by the rear cover''s matte finish, though I did detect some creakiness around the power and volume keys on the right-hand edge.</p><p>Speaking of which, these keys &ndash; along with the dedicated camera shutter key further down the same side &ndash; are of a pretty typical size and shape, with little definition and nothing much to set them apart from each other.

It''s especially assuring to note that Nokia has included Gorilla Glass 3, which is something the Lumia 1520 was missing.</p><p>Nokia may have downgraded the Nokia Lumia 1320''s display from the 1080p beauty of the Lumia 1520, but it certainly doesn''t feel like a substandard component. This is a 6-inch LCD IPS display, which means that it''s crisp and bright even when viewed from an angle.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/front-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Front"></figure></p><p>Still, the lack of a Full HD display is noticeable in general usage.

Small text on web pages is slightly blurry, and images are that little bit less sharp.</p><p>Of course, if you''ve never used the 1520 or similar &ndash; as I''d guess most potential Lumia 1320 owners won''t have &ndash; you probably won''t notice the drop in quality.</p><p>I''ll discuss it more in the appropriate section, but the Windows Phone operating system itself doesn''t massively suffer for the drop in resolution. The current iteration of Microsoft''s mobile OS was designed with 720p as the standard, so it looks and handles just fine here.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/front20buttons-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Front buttons"></figure></p><p>On the front of the device you''ll find the usual three capacitive button set-up &ndash; back (which can also be used to access multitasking), Windows, and search, and they''re as usable as on every other Windows Phone handset.</p><p>Nokia phones typically look and feel very good for their price, but the Nokia Lumia 1320 arguably doesn''t.</p><p>Its plain looks and creaky plastic feel are more reminiscent of one of the company''s entry-level phones, like the .

Both the  and the  have screens that rock the same resolution, but neither of them have the jaw-dropping clout of the Super AMOLED HD screen on offer here.</p><p>On top of that, there''s a much faster processor packed under the hood, ample storage space for media thanks to an expandable memory card slot, and the likes of , Bluetooth 4.0,  and pretty much any other connection you care to mention on board. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/20130423142101-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 review"></figure></p><p>Samsung has tried to supplement this with a tranche of software upgrades too, meaning a more powerful camera, a better way to communicate with your friends and consume media, and interestingly a big push into health through dedicated apps too.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S4 has unsurprisingly dropped in price on contract and it can be had around &pound;23 per month, which isn''t too bad for a handset which is still pretty well specced.</p><p>It can also be had for just &pound;380 SIM-free at Carphone Warehouse, while if you fancy a PAYG deal EE is offering the Galaxy S4 for &pound;339.99, which makes it a decent proposition... and it''s much cheaper than the equivalent 16GB  too.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/2013-04-232012.07.28-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Galaxy S4 review"></figure></p><p>But before we dissect all the possibilities the phone has to offer, let''s look at the design. As we mentioned, it''s impressive in its form factor, thanks to the sub-8mm thickness, and at 130g it manages to still be light without shaving off so much heft that you feel like you''ve got a flimsy piece of plastic.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/20130423142845-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 review"></figure></p><p>That''s probably the biggest compliment we can pay the Samsung Galaxy S4 - where its predecessor felt a little bit cheap in the hand, the S4 manages to bring a much more solid build and better construction to boot. </p><p>So while the "faux metal" band makes a comeback on this model, it looks a lot more premium. And there''s very little flex in the chassis when you hold it tightly, which was another problem with the  at times. </p><p>It can get dented very easily though, and be careful not to crack your screen if you do so - we''ve heard of a few instances where this has happened to S4 users, although that can be said of many other polycabonate smartphones.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/20130423142947hdr-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 review"></figure></p><p>That doesn''t mean that the phone is completely remodelled from the S3 - it''s very similar in appearance, so much so that a number of people asking to see it during our review thought we were palming them off with our old S3. The polycarbonate chassis remains, but that brings with it the faithful battery cover, which conceals a removable battery and microSD slot.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/20130423143113-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 review"></figure></p><p>We''re not so fussed about the battery being able to drop out of the phone - so few people carry around a spare battery, and nowadays portable charging blocks are becoming so cheap and light that they make much more sense too. </p><p>We''d almost prefer something like the Sony Xperia Z1, which has a refined and packaged chassis but doesn''t need a removable battery: it makes use of a slot instead for the memory card. This integrated nature would make for a slightly more premium feel to the phone.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/20130423142744hdr-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 review"></figure></p><p>However, it''s a small gripe with the S4, as while the cover feels flimsy, it''s better than it was on the  and the S3, and they both sold like hot cakes.</p><p>In the hand, the Samsung Galaxy S4 feels much better than any other Samsung phone we''ve held (apart from the gargantuan smartphones the brand used to make - the i8910  might have been built like a brick, but it felt wonderful to hold). The screen''s spread towards the sides of the phone means a much narrower bezel, and the effect is certainly impressive.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/20130423142911-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 review"></figure></p><p>It might look very similar to the S3, but when you take the Samsung Galaxy S4 up close, you really start to appreciate the nuances.</p><p>We''d say it feels a lot more like the  range now - when we first picked it up, we were struck with how similar it felt in terms of sturdiness and the polycarbonate construction to the . </p><p>It''s since been mimicked once more by the , which is a real competitor to this handset - it''s got the same uglier plastic case, but much improved innards at the same price.</p><p>That''s no criticism, as the device is well built, but it has a similar rounded feel. This is intriguing given the history of the two companies, and shows more of a leaning towards the plastic shell from the Asian brands in general.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/20130423142329hdr-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 review"></figure></p><p>Buttonry has barely changed from before - the power button has been shifted slightly on the right-hand side, and is now much easier to hit. Samsung has clearly taken some lessons from the , which has a really well positioned power/lock button. </p><p>The volume key is less easy to hit, and could be lower down in our eyes, but the travel on both of these buttons is satisfying, and you''ll always know when you''ve hit them.</p><p>The plastic used on the home key has been upgraded too, with a more solid feel under the thumb when you press down to get back to the main home screen. The two buttons flanking it give you access to menus or take you back from whence you came, and while both are easily hidden, they light up nicely with an even glow when called into action.</p><p>There are loads of sensors on the front of the phone above the screen, including cameras to track your eyes, a 2MP camera for HD video calling and a proximity sensor for knowing where the phone is in relation to your ear. On the white review unit we had, their presence looks rather ugly either side of the generous earpiece, but on the darker models this is less of an issue.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/20130423142308-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy S4 review"></figure></p><p>The other notable addition to the design of the Galaxy S4 is the infra red blaster on the top of the phone. This enables you to control your TV, satellite box, DVD player, amp and even air conditioner. Again, this isn''t a new feature, but it works well in practice, and despite being small is powerful enough indeed.</p><p>Other than that, there''s not a lot more to say about the design of the phone, as it''s just a little underwhelming. We know it''s unfair to lambast a brand for not overhauling the design every year, but in the  and the One, HTC has proven that it is possible to offer up a new design each time around and still keep things attractive.</p><p>Looking so similar to the Galaxy S3, you can''t help but feel Samsung has gone a little too Apple and created something more in keeping with the Samsung Galaxy S3S - a minor update to a great phone to keep those coming out of contract happy that they have a premium phone to upgrade to.</p><p>We do implore you to get the phone in your hand before making a judgement though - while it''s not got the best design on the market when it comes to materials, it''s a big step forward compared to the Galaxy S3 and allows for a grippy and easy-to-hold phone, with a whopping screen inside.</p><p>It still feels cheap as chips compared to the  and HTC One though.</p><p>But to just dismiss it for being plastic would be doing the S4 a disservice as it has so much more going for it than that, but it''s worth remembering that to a lot of people, the way a phone looks is as important as how much RAM it''s got on board and how fast the CPU is - if not more so.</p> ', '', 'galaxys4-press-06-160-80.jpg', 'samsunggalaxys4review03-580-100.jpg', NULL, 'The Samsung Galaxy S4 is now over a year old and if you haven''t heard it''s been replaced in 2014', 'The Samsung Galaxy S4 is now over a year old and if you haven''t heard it''s been replaced in 2014 by the Korean firm''s latest flagship offering, the .Its replacement hasn''t spelt the end for', '', 1, 3),

All that aside, Fire OS seems very limited compared to Android, and it''s not as intuitive as we might''ve hoped.</p>\n<p>But now that we have the Fire Phone in our hands, and we''ve had some time to play with it, how does it stack up to our expectations? In short, we really aren''t surprised with reality versus our predictions, and we''ll tell you why.</p>\n<h3>Hardware</h3>\n<p>The Fire Phone is very much like the LG Nexus 4, with a rubberized edge with glass front and back. You''ll find a power button at the top edge of the phone, volume and camera buttons on the left edge and a home button at the base of the face of the device.</p>\n<p>While the Fire Phone has a 1280 x 720, 4.7-inch display, it''s sharp enough that images and text look pretty good. Sure, it''s no LG G3 QHD display, but at 315 PPI, the Fire Phone looks fine in most situations.</p>\n<p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/fire-phone-7-580-100.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire Phone review" /></p>\n<p>The glass back is prone to fingerprint smudges, but wipes away easily. Amazon''s logo is emblazoned on the back just below the 13MP camera and flash. The front-facing camera is a 2.1MP shooter, and both cameras are capable of recording 1080p HD video.</p>\n<p>You''ll also notice four cameras on the corners of the face of the device, and the reason they exist is because of Dynamic Perspective, or the simulated 3D display.</p>\n<p>Since this isn''t our in-depth review, it''s sufficient to say that the hardware is OK, but not the best there is on the market. For that, we''d have to give our nods to the HTC One M8 and iPhone 5S.</p>\n<p>It feels nice in the hand, again, reminiscent of the Nexus 4, but we are quite concerned about that glass back and whether the internal specs will be future-proof.</p>\n<h3>Software</h3>\n<p>The software on the Amazon Fire Phone is confusing. When you fire up the phone for the first time, there is a five minute tutorial on using the phone.</p>\n<p>It might be bold to say this, but if your phone starts with a lengthy tutorial on how to use it, then it probably isn''t very intuitive from the start.</p>\n<p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/fire-phone-6-580-100.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire Phone review" /></p>\n<p>If you''ve owned the Kindle Fire, or Kindle Fire HDX, some UI elements will be familiar to you. The home screen is essentially a carousel of your most recently used apps. To get rid of those apps from the carousel, press and hold the app icon and select to remove it.</p>\n<p>There are also panels that are revealed when you swipe from the left-most or right-most edges of the phone. These panels reveal options to see apps, games, music and more, and the other side shows updates such as weather and email notifications.</p>\n<p>Swiping down from the top shows your notifications and quick toggle buttons for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, for example, along with a quick button for Amazon''s Mayday service - or its live technical support/help feature.</p>\n<p>The top-down notification pane isn''t animated like Android or iOS, but it works the same.</p>\n<p>Flicking the phone around with certain gestures will also bring up these panels and notification centers, but it doesn''t always work so smoothly. It can be frustrating.</p>\n<p>Since the Fire Phone has only a physical home button, and no other hard or soft buttons, you''ll find yourself wishing there was a back button. To go back in most apps, you have to swipe upward from the very bottom of the display, which isn''t intuitive and makes no sense. This was frustrating at first, but I''ve reluctantly become accustomed to it.</p>\n<p>As we dive deeper into this phone, we''ll have more on the software, but these are our initial impressions.</p>\n<h3>Dynamic Perspective</h3>\n<p>Having faux-3D on the Fire Phone is a neat effect for the first three seconds that you take a look at it. After that, it''s not really all that useful.</p>\n<p>It''s a parlor trick that can be cool for the first or second time, but after a while it becomes a nuisance and you can easily recognize that it''s completely unnecessary.</p>\n<p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/fire-phone-5-580-100.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire Phone review" /></p>\n<p>Your first experience with it will be the lock screen, which reveals slightly new angles when you tilt the phone around while you''re facing it. This thing could be useful in maps for peeking around buildings and other areas, but you can also do that with your fingers in every other maps app.</p>\n<p>There is not a single instance I can think of when Dynamic Perspective wouldn''t have worked just fine using a two-finger pinch, pull and swipe method.</p>\n<h3>Firefly</h3>\n<p>Firefly is actually a feature that could be cool if it wasn''t so blatantly obvious that it''s just a tool to get you to buy crap on Amazon.</p>\n<p>When you fire up the Firefly app, you can use your phone''s camera to identify objects, and if that object exists in the Amazon store, you''ll be given a link to go straight to it.</p>\n<p>If the item you''re scanning with your Fire Phone''s camera isn''t in the Amazon store, most of the results will be null and void.</p>\n<p>And of course, Firefly can also recognize music and TV and movies. Since Amazon offers those things for sale, you bet Firefly is going to be capable of recognizing your tunes and shows and movies, and direct you right where you need to go to buy them.</p>\n<p>Is it useful? It could be; Firefly is another neat trick that can help you identify certain things, with the added and sometimes unwanted bonus of being nudged into going into Amazon''s product page.</p>\n<h3>Early Verdict</h3>\n<p>The Fire Phone has what you need for a modern smartphone to be acceptable. It has a high definition screen, though nowhere near the resolution of Android flagship devices. It also has a decent 13MP camera, though it''s not on par with the likes of the LG G3 or iPhone 5S.</p>\n<p>You''ll find that the Fire Phone also has pretty good hardware, but nothing as pretty or soulful as the HTC One M8 or iPhone 5S.</p>\n<p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/fire-phone-8-580-100.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire Phone review" /></p>\n<p>For everything the Fire Phone is decent at, there is an Android flagship or iPhone device that does it much better. And that should not be the case for a phone that''s just as expensive as the rest of them, and a company''s first go at smartphones.</p>\n<p>It''ll make calls, send messages, do e-mail, browse the web and allow you to use some apps and games. But then again, most phones do that these days. What matters is the overall experience, and whether there is that sense of quality or conscientiousness behind the product as a whole.</p>\n<p>It doesn''t feel like Amazon gave this phone much thought, other than to find a way to put a portal into its store right in our pockets - as if the Amazon iOS or Android apps weren''t enough.</p>', '', 'fire-phone-1-160-80.jpg', 'fire-phone-7-580-100.jpg', NULL, 'The Amazon Fire Phone has finally arrived, and leading up to its debut we''ve already voiced our', 'The Amazon Fire Phone has finally arrived, and leading up to its debut we''ve already voiced our opinions about the device.

It''s nearly 30% cheaper? Oh. That makes sense.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, we''re treated to the HTC One M8 spec for spec. That means a Snapdragon 801 chip inside, the same larger 2600mAh battery, a glorious Full HD 5-inch Super LCD3 screen, a microSD slot and, well, you might as well just read the spec sheet for the One M8 to get the full picture.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htconee8review201-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One E8 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Oh - the IR blaster on the top is gone. That''s important if you like the thought of controlling your TV with a phone.</p>\n<h3>Plastic back</h3>\n<p>So, let''s get down to it: how does the new polycarbonate cladding feel in the hand? I was sent the Electric Crimson version of the phone to test out (come on, if that''s an option on the list to choose, it was impossible to go for anything else) and it''s a shiny plastic, rather than the matte grey finish.</p>\n<p>This means it''s as slippy, if not even less grippable, than the metal of the One M8, although if you plump for the matte version you''ll be able to hold onto it a little better.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htconee8review2010-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One E8 review" /><figcaption>It''s hard to explain how slippy this phone is</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The plastic back feels solid, makes the phone lighter and, as I said, dispenses with the IR blaster on the top, which has the effect of moving the power button to the centre. It''s a slightly odd place to put it, but it''s easy to hit and still raised.</p>\n<p>It''s intriguingly the same design as seen on the original ... well, intriguing if you''ve got nothing else to think about.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htconee8review2011-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One E8 review" /><figcaption>The power key - full of design mystery</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The volume key on the right-hand side is also plastic, as you''d expect, and probably feels like the cheapest part of the phone. I''m not a fan of the lighter chassis, as I loved the great balance of the One M8, but the One E8 will probably appeal to those looking to spend less without losing the unibody package experience.</p>\n<h3>No IR</h3>\n<p>Is the lack of an infra-red port, the thing that lets you control your TV with your phone, a big loss to the phone? Well, apart from making the aesthetic of the One E8 a little less sumptuous, it''s barely missed.</p>\n<p>I keep pointing out that holding your phone like a remote control is impossible as you''re missing the tactility of the buttons, but apart from LG with the  (which had the sensor on the back, meaning you could hold the phone up to see what you''re pressing) nobody has done anything about it.</p>\n<p>The disappearance might irk some, but in reality it wouldn''t be missed on the One M8.</p>\n<h3>Lower price</h3>\n<p>Of course, the main reason for losing many of the good bits of the One M8 on the E8 is the price drop, and it''s pretty big considering.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htconee8review2015-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One E8 review" /><figcaption>The locked-in SIM and microSD trays remain</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Word is it could come in at around £350 in the UK, and will be around 30% cheaper than the One M8 in other markets SIM free, so if you get your hands on the One E8 (and that''s a big if, as HTC has yet to confirm availability in the more premium smartphone markets, focusing the E8 in other more developing parts of the world) you''ll be paying a lot less.</p>\n<p>It''s hard to say whether this is the right move - it depends if the One M8 and E8 will be sold side by side. If they are, then it''s a cannibalisation exercise. People won''t want to pay that much more for a metal back and two cameras, and it could harm the sales of the One M8 as a result.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htconee8review203-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One E8 review" /><figcaption>Confirmed: you can use it on trees</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Also, where does the One Mini 2 fit into the equation? Or the Desire 816? For a company that was planning to make fewer phones, HTC is certainly churning out the handsets.</p>\n<h3>Upgraded camera</h3>\n<p>Here''s something that will confuse a lot of people if the two phones are placed side by side in a shop (although we''ve yet to find out if they will): the camera on the HTC One E8 is going to be a 13MP affair, with single flash LED rather than the all-singing One M8, with its Duo Camera and Ultrapixels and Ufocus background defocus.</p>\n<p>The 13MP snapper here has all the power and toys the One M8 has (bar the defocus post processing) so you can take Zoes, HDR shots, videos and more without a problem.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/htconee8review2017-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HTC One E8 review" /><figcaption>Doesn''t look as fancy as the Duo Camera</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The front facing camera remains the same (well, I''m pretty sure about that but am awaiting confirmation) so this should be another brilliant phone if you like to take loads of self portraits.</p>\n<p>But the back camera looks great still, and the sharpness from the off the shelf sensor seems to be very good indeed. HTC better hope that shops don''t sell these phones with 13MP and 4MP specs listed next to one another, or else it will get very confusing.</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>There''s a lot here that I''m missing from the One M8, but not as much as I thought I would. The build quality is a lot lower, but the colour of my sample and the well-packaged unibody mitigates that somewhat.</p>\n<p>The camera, in the early tests, performs very well, but I''ve not tried it in the full range of low light and differing texture tests, so I''ll be intrigued to see how that pans out.</p>\n<p>Essentially, this budget version of the One M8 isn''t that budget - but it does provide competition to the likes of the Nexus 5 and the OnePlus One for a high-end phone with great specs and a lower price, and it appears HTC has managed that well here.</p>', '', 'htconee8review204-160-80.jpg', 'htconee8review2011-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'The HTC One E8 is the phone I never thought I''d see.

One can argue that there is only so much you can do with the modern-day smartphone form factor, but then again HTC and Sony have very distinct designs.</p><p>The edges of the device are clean, free of volume controls and a power button. The bottom edge of the phone has a 3.5mm headset jack, micro-USB port and a speaker and microphone. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lgg2review4-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G2 review"></figure></p><p>The G2''s backside is the business end of the phone. LG decided to put the volume buttons and power button just underneath the camera module. </p><p>LG says its the reason the volume and power keys were placed on the back is because that''s where your finger naturally wants to rest when you''re talking on your phone, which I generally found to be true.</p><p>It can become awkward feeling around for the buttons, as In order to get enough pressure onto the power button, you have to hold the G2 a little awkwardly and make sure you get the correct leverage. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lgg2review8-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G2 review"></figure></p><p>But the South Korean brand has made a huge effort to mitigate this, with elements like double knocking on the screen to open it up (which removes the need to press the power button) and most apps have an onscreen volume control to play with.</p><p>Plus over time I noticed myself becoming increasingly okay with the placement of the keys - to the point when I switched phones and found that I was pressing the camera lens to turn the phone on.</p><p>Aside from the power/volume buttons and the camera module on the backside, there isn''t a whole lot more going on back there. </p><p>The metal-looking LG logo towards the bottom of the device however turns out to be just a few stickers, which over time have started to fall off.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lgg2review1-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G2 review"></figure></p><p>The plastic rear chassis also gets beaten up pretty easily, and if you''re not careful your G2 will pick up various dents and markings.

Expandable memory? This just gets better and better.</p><p>This means that theoretically you''ll be able to have a 128GB-capacity Samsung Galaxy S3 if you combine the top spec of internal memory (64GB) with the largest microSD card around at the moment (64GB)... making it a mouth-watering prospect for those who love a spot of media.

Not just one Android phone, but a whole range.</p><p>There was more than a little irony in seeing Stephen Elop, once a Microsoft stalwart and the architect of Nokia''s Windows Phone strategy announcing these new devices on stage. He went to great pains to point out that the Nokia X is a phone running AOSP, the Android Open Source Project.</p><p>This project underpins every Android phone in the world. As always in the Nokia story, it is not quite as simple as that. While the Nokia X runs Android, it does not run Google Android.</p><p>Briefly, Android as we know it is typically made of two parts; the underlying Android system and the Google apps. The underlying Android system is what the Nokia X runs along with all the usual well known Android phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S range and the .</p><p>Unlike those devices though, the Nokia X does not run Google apps. In order to run Google apps &ndash; Gmail, Maps, Calendar, Google Now etc &ndash; phones need to be certified. Nokia has not taken this step and it has done so on purpose.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia X"></figure></p><p>The Nokia X software is based off of Android 4.1, a version released in July 2012. There is so far no information on updates but we can only hope  is planned as that version is designed to run on lower end hardware.</p><p>Nokia has designed the X to use the equivalent services from itself and from Microsoft, and Nokia has provided an API for everything that Google provides meaning that developers should be able to port apps quite easily.</p><p>This makes the Nokia X an Android phone by name, but one that would perhaps be unfamiliar to those already used to running Android on other mainstream devices. If you are thinking of switching to the Nokia X from another Android device, it is most important to note that the Play Store is not available. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p3-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia X"></figure></p><p>It is possible to side-load any legally obtainable apps including other app stores such as the Amazon app store, but even that wont bring Google services to the Nokia X.</p><p>Who would have imagined a Microsoft product running Android? It does seem like an anomaly, and by the looks of it that''s exactly what the Nokia X will be - an anomaly.</p><p>Microsoft has announced that it will be , leaving just four Nokia branded handsets running the heavily modified version of Google''s platform - the X, X+, XL and X2.</p><p>Moving on from this muted outlook, what do you get on the Nokia X? The standout software included are Nokia HERE Maps, a fantastic alternative to Google apps, and Nokia MixRadio which is a great way to stream your favorite music on demand. </p><p>Instead of the Play Store you will find the Nokia Store, which is already starting to fill out with many top apps. Nokia include Facebook and Twitter apps along with BlackBerry Messenger as standard. Various simple games are loaded on the X as well. All these apps run on a heavily customised version of Android 4.1.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p4-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia X review"></figure></p><p>Powering the Nokia X is a dual-core Snapdragon S4 Play processor running at 1GHz with 512Mb of RAM and 4GB of internal storage, which can be supplemented by a microSD card. The X has a 4-inch WVGA (800 x 480) LCD display and a fixed focus 3MP camera on the back. There''s no front facing shooter.</p><p>These are very modest specs indeed and that does end up informing the whole experience of using the Nokia X.</p><p>What makes up for that is the price, the range starts at just &euro;89, &pound;80 (around $120, AU$135). This is a phone targeted at emerging markets, at people who are buying their first smartphone and perhaps their first phone. Some buyers of the Nokia X will have never bought any sort of computing device before.</p><p>Nokia has brought the X range to Europe, including the UK, but it has been clearly designed to replace the top end of Nokia''s Asha range of phones. The Asha range is filled with very nicely designed but slow and simple feature phones, which have very limited capabilities. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/screen20on-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia X review"></figure></p><p>The Nokia X is a decent step up from an Asha device and has the potential to do a lot more. Here in the UK, other reasonable smartphones are available for a similar price as the X but in its first market, India, this is not the case. Phones at a similar price point suffer from extremely bad design and build quality and very poor performance.</p><p>Despite the meager specifications and just a 1500mAh battery, the Nokia X provides a reasonable upgrade for users in these emerging markets who are upgrading from either feature phones or locally produced budget handsets which simply will not have Nokia''s level of design and build.</p><p>When you pull the rear shell off the Nokia X model it is possible to see another indicator as to the target markets for this new range. The Nokia X is a dual SIM device.</p><p>In many other markets, the best value for cellular connectivity is achieved by separating your contracts for voice usage and data usage, which mandates two SIM cards. It''s like running your calls through Vodafone and your data through T-Mobile.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/buttons-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia X review"></figure></p><p>On the X, the dual SIM setup supports dual standby that means both SIM cards can be active at the same time. Only slot one supports 3G connections, so that is where you will want to put your data SIM. Both slots are of the micro SIM variety. There is no 4G in sight here, but that is hardly a surprise.</p><p>The X range comes in a lovely range of colours with the basic X is available in black, white, cyan, yellow, bright red and the bright green, which is especially striking. The slightly higher spec X+ shares the same palette while the larger XL swaps the red for an even nicer orange colour.</p><p>Nokia has done what Nokia always seems to do at the budget end of its range.

It''s got a higher spec sheet than ever before, the still-great camera and all of the Finnish / American toys it can pack on board, and it''s coming out of the gate for cheaper than the competition too.</p><p>On top of that you''ve got a decent accessory ecosystem around it, a strong identity and an ever-growing user base for Windows Phone.</p><p>But there''s also the other side of it: the Lumia 930 is using last year''s components and still has to battle against the fact Windows Phone is still running behind iOS and Android in both the popularity and app stakes.</p><p>It''s a tricky one &ndash; read on to see if the new Lumia could possibly be your next phone.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="WFq6qWQ6653WO"></div><h3>ClearBlack display</h3><p>The first thing that you''ll notice about the -powered device is the fact it''s got a much improved screen over its predecessors. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nokia20lumia2093020review2013-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>The ClearBlack display is just that: clear and capable of display deep blacks</figcaption></figure></p><p>Yes, the  had a large 1080p screen, but it was much bigger than the 5-inch version on show here and as such the sharpness suffered as a result.</p><p>But the AMOLED ClearBlack display used on the Lumia 930 is just brilliant. I''ve had too many tedious arguments with others about the benefits of LCD over OLED technology (yes, such is the effervescent life of a technology journalist) but you can''t argue that OLED just looks better.</p><p>Whether it''s the deep blacks, rich contrast or generally decent colour reproduction (which Nokia has nailed with its ClearBlack technology) the screen quality on the Lumia 930 is a really lovely experience.</p><p>It makes the live tiles really stand out on the home screen, and combined with Nokia''s love of colour, the whole effect is really rather nice. </p><p>One of the key benefits of OLED technology is the fact that when a portion of the screen is black, it''s completely switched off. This means that the disparity between bright white sections and the darker portions is more apparent, and from the moment you switch on the Lumia 930 you get the sense that this is a good quality phone.</p><p>There''s also the battery saving element (if a pixel is off, it''s drawing a lot less power... actually, pretty much none) so that''s a benefit too.</p><h3>Metallic rim</h3><p>I''m going to come onto the design of the Lumia 930 in the next section of this review, but it''s worth talking about here as it''s something Nokia is using as a real selling point for its new handset.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nokia20lumia2093020review206-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>A strong edge</figcaption></figure></p><p>The combination of a metallic rim and polycarbonate back is nothing new, but Nokia''s bolstered the strength of the phone with this year''s design, and it works pretty well.</p><p>The lighter grey exterior has a very Scandinavian feel to it, and combines well with the brighter colours - although you can get black and white versions if you prefer your smartphone a bit more low key.</p><p>It feels solid in the hand, but the weight and thickness is pretty hefty for a 2014 flagship smartphone... it''s hard to work out why Nokia has increased things here, but it''s definitely a design that stands out from the crowd and offers a very well-built phone.</p><h3>Windows Phone 8.1</h3><p>Again, I feel like I''m ruining a later section, but the update to Windows Phone is a key selling point of the Lumia 930, at least in the early days of sale.</p><p>There aren''t a huge amount of phones packing the update at this point, and users will benefit from new elements like a notification area (Action Center), more options with the background wallpaper and more live tile options than ever before.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nokia20lumia2093020review2010-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>It''s good, but still needs more to impress</figcaption></figure></p><p>Sadly, in the UK there''s no look at Cortana yet, but that will be coming pretty soon we''re told, and that will offer some decent access to one of the best voice assistants on a smartphone.</p><p>Windows Phone 8.1 pushes the OS forward by a huge amount - it was sorely needed, and doesn''t quite get it up with the best, but just a little bit closer. Nokia''s Lumia 930 is a good poster boy for this, and the combination of power and design gives a good experience under the finger.</p><h3>Pureview 20MP camera</h3><p>Nokia''s camera heritage has been a mainstay of the mobile phone for nearly a decade now, since the decision to stick a snapper on the back of a handset.</p><p>With Pureview Nokia''s really owning this space, with the  still arguably the best camera-on-a-phone out there (not the best cameraphone, as what''s running underneath is sub par).</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nokia20lumia2093020review203-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>A great snapper</figcaption></figure></p><p>The Pureview sensor on the Lumia 930 is similar to that seen on the Lumia 1520, which is a shame, as I was really hoping for something really advanced and could allow me to stop carrying the 1020 around with me.</p><p>It''s not in the same league as the 41MP sensor on that device, but it''s still very much one of the best on the market, as you''ll see with the later camera samples.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="PSB8lAvB1w850"></div><h3>Here and there</h3><p>Another of Nokia''s big strengths is the Here suite of products that it bundles with the Nokia Lumia range - and will probably be completely available on all Windows Phone devices in the future if Microsoft has anything to say about it.</p><p>The big hitters are Here Maps and Mix Radio in my opinion - the former being a big win because of the ability to take maps offline as well as relevant information being spread throughout the app.</p><p>It''s a much better app than it used to be too - while you still need to download plugins to make it fully functional, at least those extra bits are now available. It allows for easy mapping and is arguably a more coherent sat nav option than those from Apple or Google, which you should note if you''re one to use your phone to navigate around in the car.</p><p>However, it''s still not up to the standard of Google Maps, either in interface or general functionality. What you gain in offline capability and relevant information you lose in general interface - the slower way of flicking through the map (even with the extra grunt of the quadcore Snapdragon 800 chip running under the hood) shows that this is still something that needs more work to be a real competitor.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nokia20lumia2093020review2018-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>Nokia''s onboard app offering still needs work</figcaption></figure></p><p>Mix Radio is an interesting proposition though. The idea is that it forces new music onto you (and for free, which is brilliant) and even lets you sync offline without paying any more.</p><p>The range of genres and pre-mixed playlists is really something, and despite downloading Spotify as well (which needs a lot more work on Windows Phone) I found myself initially drawn to this app to see what was on offer music-wise.</p><p>However, it didn''t take long to start to fall out of love, as it relies heavily on a connection most of the time, and if you go underground or on a train with low signal it can really upset the functionality of the app. This means that the playback won''t work over and over again despite being able to connect, and if you''ve part-downloaded a playlist it will confuse the life out of the app.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lumia930-press-02-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>The mapping experience disappoints</figcaption></figure></p><p>You can pay &pound;3.99/$3.99 per month and get better access to the features of the app, such as improved audio quality and unlimited skips through songs, but it''s not really that much better than the free version. </p><p>Plus you need to sign up through a Nokia account (you can do it through a Microsoft login, but that''s not quite integrated yet, which leads to an email asking you to sort out a Nokia account still) which seems a bit last century nowadays.</p><p>There are plenty of decent apps from Nokia and Microsoft to download (or are pre-installed on the phone) that really add to the functionality though - everything from Video Tuner (which allows you to easily make more shareable videos) to Nokia Beamer (an awesome app that lets you mirror your phone screen on any internet-connected device in the world) so at least the Windows Phone experience is working hard at its own apps to make the experience more enticing.</p><h3>Wireless charging</h3><p>Nokia needs to work out what it really wants when it comes to wireless charging. Enabled in the , it''s been stripped out of subsequent light-named smartphones.</p><p>It''s back in the Lumia 930, and as such adds a huge amount of heft to the design, apparently. I get that Nokia decided to let it be an option extra in recent models, in the shape of a snap-on case, as that gave consumers choice.</p><p>Sadly, it seemed that they chose to not use it, so Nokia has made it mandatory once again. It''s great to see, and even better that there''s a wireless charging pad in the box - THAT''S what consumers need to make wireless charging happen.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lumia930-press-04-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review"><figcaption>The wireless charger comes in the box</figcaption></figure></p><p>However, I don''t get why it''s added so much depth to the phone (assuming that''s the reason), as other models, such as the , can manage it in a very slim profile.</p><p>But overall wireless charging being part of the set up is a big, big win. Not needing to plug your phone in for the first time as you put your head on the pillow is really awesome - this is the kind of futuristic stuff I was expecting years ago.</p> ', '', 'nokia20lumia2093020review2011-160-80.jpg', 'nokia20lumia2093020review206-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'Windows Phone is going on four years old now &ndash; and it''s still never had the standout phone', 'Windows Phone is going on four years old now &ndash; and it''s still never had the standout phone that shows it''s a platform that can compete with the iPhone and the best Android has to', '', 1, 3),

Is that really worth the price bump?</p><p>Alongside these extras, the Nokia Lumia 635 offers the same 4.5-inch 854 x 480 display, the same quad-core Snapdragon 400 CPU backed by 512MB of RAM, the same 8GB of storage, and the same 5-megapixel rear camera as the 630.</p><p>In fact, it inherits pretty much all of its sibling''s strengths and weaknesses. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/press201-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 635 review"><figcaption>As you''d expect for a Nokia phone, the Lumia 635 comes in a selection of bright colours</figcaption></figure></p><p>With the average smartphone size seemingly expanding by the year, the Nokia Lumia 635 almost feels small in the hand.

At 854 x 480, the resolution is distinctly behind the smartphone curve.

IPS and ClearBlack technology combine to ensure that viewing angles and outdoor legibility are above what you''d normally expect from a "cheap" smartphone.</p><p>However, I was disappointed that there was no apparent sign of Nokia''s super sensitive touch display technology, meaning you can''t operate the phone with gloves on. This was even present in the Nokia Lumia 520, so it''s not as if it''s a high-end feature.</p><p>Nor do you get the desirable tap-to-power-on option that the likes of the  possessed, or the ability to glance at the time and whether you have any new notifications by hovering your finger over the display. The absence of these features is perhaps a little more understandable as Nokia strives to keep costs down on the Lumia 635.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/hold20headphone-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 635 review"><figcaption>Headphones are plugged into the top of the phone</figcaption></figure></p><p>Aside from a somewhat underwhelming display, the Nokia Lumia 635 is a pretty desirable piece of kit. Like the Nokia Lumia 630, it features a clever two-part design that almost makes it feel like one of Nokia''s premium unibody constructions.</p><p>The screen, the removable battery, and all of the phone''s innards for that matter are all contained within a skeletal core unit. The other part of the Lumia 635 is an extended cover, made of fairly thick plastic (or ''polycarbonate'' to use the fancy official branding), which fits around the back and the sides of the device.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/back20bench-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 635 review"><figcaption>The case is sturdy, but that glossy effect isn''t the most attractive look</figcaption></figure></p><p>Once clicked into place, this is a solid device with minimal flexing or creaking. We''ve said it before, but no one does affordable phone design as well as Nokia.</p><p>Having said that, I didn''t find the Nokia Lumia 635 to be as nice to look at or hold as the Nokia Lumia 630. It''s opted for a glossy dual-layer effect, which makes it look like it''s covered by a thin, clear gel layer.</p><p>While this differentiates the Lumia 635 from the 630, I preferred the latter''s matte finish. Not only does it look nicer (which is admittedly subjective), it also feels nicer in the hand (which is less so). There''s a certain clammy greasiness that accompanies the Lumia 635''s slick finish, especially in warmer conditions.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/hold20side-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nokia Lumia 635 review"><figcaption>The Lumia 635 is a reasonably slim phone</figcaption></figure></p><p>Otherwise, the dimensions of these two Nokia Lumia phones are identical. Like the 630, the Lumia 635 weighs 134g, and measures 9.2mm thick.

That''s only a small part of the story though, and underneath the hood Samsung has continued its play of stuffing all the latest specs in and optimising them in a way that doesn''t suck down oodles of battery.</p><p>Is this phone good enough to keep Samsung fighting with Apple at the top of the sales charts? Yes, but that''s mostly through the impressive marketing machine that rolls out in every territory. Samsung needs this to be the last phone that rolls with such design language - the Galaxy S6 needs to be the dawn of a new age for the South Korean company, something to give consumers real lust for the way it looks.</p><p>Critically, it feels like there''s very little to shout about with the Galaxy S5 &ndash; but perhaps that''s no bad thing for a brand that was accused of bringing pointless innovation with last year''s model.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="zK46WzdBvonfb"></div><h3>Design</h3><p>I''ve always played it safe when talking about the design of a Samsung phone.

Like its big brother, the Ascend P6, there''s more than a whiff of Apple''s  about it &ndash; thanks largely to the faux-metal strip running along the outside of the chassis.</p><p>The 4.5-inch, 960 x 540 LCD display is bordered by a fairly sizable bezel that is most noticeable at the bottom where a plastic lip protrudes beneath the Android soft-touch navigation keys.

When the phone is in one piece it tips the scales at only 115g and measures 130 x 65 x 7.5mm. </p><p>In real-world terms, this means it''s a good size for one-handed operation and neither too heavy nor too light thanks to the plastic casing.</p><p>On the right hand side are the physical volume rocker keys and the on/off power switch. Unlike most other handsets, the microUSB port can be found on the top of the device, while the 3.5mm headphone jack is located at the bottom on the left hand side of the chassis. </p><p>I did find this beneficial when using headphones as the natural movement is to put the phone head-first into your pocket which, in this case, means less tangled headphone wires.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/huawei20ascend20g620hands20on2019-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Huawei Ascend G6 review"></figure></p><p>A small speaker grill is built into the bottom left of the rear of the phone while the camera lens and flash are above it, tucked into the top left. </p><p>Unfortunately, these particular placements can cause a bit of a problem when holding the phone in landscape mode as I found on occasion my fingers would cover the speaker when watching a video or slightly obscure the lens when taking a picture. </p><p>A more sensible design would be that of the  with front-facing speakers and a camera lens placed more centrally.</p><p>Huawei has done a better job of placement on the front of the phone with the camera lens again tucked up in the left hand corner, which makes it easy to quickly snap a one handed selfie. A small green light also appears on the right of the Huawei logo to let you know if you have an email, text message or notification that needs addressing.</p><p>Powering the Ascend G6 is a reasonable ARM 1.2GHz quad-core processor backed with 1GB of RAM. While the operating system is Google''s Android 4.3 Jelly Bean (no KitKat here), Huawei has overlaid it with the same Emotion UI that featured on last year''s Ascend P6 and again on the newly released . </p><p>The result is a rather more cutesy tone with some extra homegrown features thrown in that I''ll address in more detail later.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/huawei20ascend20g620hands20on2023-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Huawei Ascend G6 review"></figure></p><p>The aforementioned microSD card is an absolute necessity as Huawei has only loaded the Ascend G6 with 4GB of native storage space. Space that will, as expected, fill up fast when you start loading on media and downloading apps.</p><p>In terms of first impressions, the Huawei Ascend G6 doesn''t cut a bad figure. But I would say that the rather mature outward design of the handset jars slightly with the childish Emotion UI. Considering the price and the bracket in which the Ascend G6 falls though, it''s difficult to find fault with the way the phone looks and the level of hardware that Huawei has built into it. </p><p>But how does it hold up once it''s out of the box and working in the real world?

(428, 'LG G3 review', 'lg-g3-review', 'Don Miller', 'Techradar', 'A great handset that''s more phablet than phone - and it''s only slightly let down by lackluster design.', '', ' <p>With the LG G3, we''re seeing a brand release a phone ahead of time in order to grab a foothold in an industry that could be spiralling away from its grasp.</p><p>It''s an odd thing to say considering we''re talking about a manufacturer that launched one of the critically acclaimed phones of 2013, with the  impressing far more than most expected.</p><p>But that was months ago, and LG has realised that with Samsung, Sony and HTC all bringing out far superior models it can''t wait until later in the year to catch up, so it''s tried to race to the front of the pack with a previously-unseen step forward in screen technology.</p><p>If you need more evidence that this is a phone that LG has accelerated to launch, check out the changes it''s made: removable battery, microSD slot, metallic frame and new, mature interface; in short, everything that was wrong with last year''s model in the eyes of many.</p><p>So with that in mind, is the LG G3 the perfect smartphone?</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="u8BX3Mc9yp7lD"></div><h3>Key features</h3><p>There are a number of key features that LG is touting as new and improved this year with the G3, but none sticks out as prominently as the QHD screen. Some might think that this is four times the pixel count of an HD screen, and you''d be right to a degree.</p><p>But only if you''re talking about 720p screens &ndash; if you''re comparing the G3 to something like the Galaxy S5, that packs in two million pixels to the G3''s 3.6 million. It''s a lot sharper, sure, but anyone thinking it''s going to be mindblowing will be disappointed.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lgg3review205-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G3 review"></figure></p><p>The big question here with the screen is: why do it? The official reason LG told me was it had done some research and had realised that Steve Jobs was wrong. </p><p>While it agreed he was right there was a limit to what the human eye can see in terms of sharpness, LG reckons that the way sight works means the Retina display isn''t the top end. That''s obvious anyway; the display on the  or  is significantly sharper than that on the , so there is more headroom.</p><p>But apparently there''s another level <em>still</em> to attack, and that''s just what it''s done with the QHD screen. Where Samsung''s offering 440ppi sharpness, the G3 has 538ppi, which is equivalent to high end glossy art books, which LG used as the benchmark of sharpness to aim at. </p><p>Dr RamChan Woo, head of smartphone planning for LG, told me that the idea was you need pixels to fill in the space between lines, to make something that sorts out the ''dead space'', which is why it went for the upper limit to make everything look premium.</p><p>Now, here''s the quandary: the screen is brilliant, no question. Internet browsing, looking at pictures, watching high-end video, is all awesome. But that''s the exact same feeling I had with the G2, which also had a simply stunning screen.</p><p>It feels like the QHD screen is great to look at because LG knows how to make an amazing display, rather that offering a next level of sharpness that blows me away. I didn''t feel that I was looking at something superior to the G2 in terms of screen quality, and with the larger heft and hit on battery life, I believe LG has gone too early with the technology just to make an impact.</p><p>Or possibly its not even early. Perhaps we just don''t need QHD screens in our phones. The display isn''t without problems either: tilt it left or right and the brightness drops off sharply, which makes sense when you consider how many pixels are packed in there.</p><p>It''s unfair to criticise the QHD screen on the G3 &ndash; there''s no doubt all high end smartphones will be using this technology in a year or so. But as a headline spec, it doesn''t seem to add a huge amount to the G3, which is a shame as I was hoping to be looking at the next generation of picture quality on a phone.</p><h3>New interface</h3><p>When it came to listing the criticisms of the LG G2, the biggest problem was the interface. It was so cluttered that if you had the remote activated and received a message you had to scroll down to see it.</p><p>Compare that to the HTC One M8, and you''ve got nothing but the missive to check. On top of that, the G2 went for a really garish and cartoony look too, meaning it was hard to evangelise on a phone that was otherwise brilliant.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lgg3review-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G3 review"></figure></p><p>The new interface on the LG G3 is a big improvement. Gone is the skeumorphism in favour of a new flat tile look. The icons are redesigned. The different applications have their own colour scheme for easy recognition and the colour palette is more muted than before.</p><p>It''s a much more fluid system that shows LG has grown up, taking the problems of before and making it into a more intuitive way of navigating through the handset.</p><p>LG has definitely taken touches from HTC, Samsung and Apple with the new interface. The home screen features a separate section for the pedometer and tips videos (where Samsung''s pointless magazine option is on the Galaxy S5), the colours are very similar to HTC''s on the M8 and the flatter design owes more than a tip of the hat to Apple.</p><p>The interface is still a little cluttered, but overall it''s a tick for LG updating something that sorely needed a new look.</p><h3>Metallic shell</h3><p>As mentioned the other big problem with the G2 was the fact it had a really glossy plastic shell. The phone was well packaged, but still didn''t offer the same premium quality as the HTC One, iPhone or Sony Xperia Z1.</p><p>So with the LG G3, the South Korean brand has gone for the best of both worlds. It''s created a ''metallic skin'' that supposedly looks and feels premium, but offers the lower weight and added connectivity benefits of polycarbonate.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lgg3review203-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G3 review"><figcaption>It might look similar, but the feel in the hand is very different</figcaption></figure></p><p>The problem is, LG hasn''t really managed this lofty goal. The G3 certainly looks the business, bringing a more iconic look of brushed metal and some cool colours (black, silver and gold) to make it stand out on the shelves, which makes sense given it''s mostly screen otherwise.</p><p>But the second you pick it up, the plastic nature jars with the look of the phone, which is a disappointment. It actually feels cheaper than the G2 thanks to using a removable back, which lowers the tightness of the packaging and makes it feel more hollow.</p><p>The upside of this is you''ve got a removable battery and microSD slot, both of which are a big win for a certain section of the customer base. That said, there are better ways of doing this, as you can easily have a slot for a microSD card without needing to remove the back.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lgg3review209-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G3 review"><figcaption>The battery and back cover are both removable</figcaption></figure></p><p>And I know a few people disagree, but a unibody phone feels better in the hand and a portable battery pack is much more useful than being able to swap in a new battery - it''s easier to charge, for one, and 98% of users will never swap the battery in and out anyway, so why bother when an integrated unit can offer more capacity and better design?</p><p>So again, LG has stepped forward with the G3 &ndash; but it''s still not quite got all the pieces together when it comes to design.</p><h3>Simple camera with laser autofocus</h3><p>The 13MP camera on the LG G3 is also another big talking point, both in terms of the new look to the interface and the additional technology on board.</p><p>I''ll start with the latter point: the laser auto focus, which is designed to make it the fastest-focusing smartphone on the market. It seems to be true at times, but I''m not sure shaving another 100 milliseconds off makes that much of a difference when boot-up speed is more important..</p><p>It''s possibly a bit unfair to say that the extra speed isn''t warranted &ndash; if the system worked perfectly, chances are you''d take 10-20 more high quality pictures that capture the moment compared to the competition, but without being able to fully test the system it''s hard to comment.</p><p>The laser works by sending out a conical infra-red signal (using technology nabbed from a robo-vacuum cleaner from LG''s home appliances division) and absorbs information from the surroundings to create an instant and clear picture for the camera to use. </p><p>This means it doesn''t have to look for contrast shifts like before, and offers a sharper image.</p><p>The interface is really scaled back too: it''s nothing more than a back button, a menu icon and the viewfinder. Tap the screen and it focuses and takes the picture, designed to be simple and effective.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lgg3review2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="LG G3 review"></figure></p><p>It also doesn''t let you focus to check the shot composition before taking the photo, which would be nice &ndash; but then again, tap that menu icon and you get all you need in terms of shutter, options and video recording.</p><p>The G3 is all about simplification, and this kind of technology really works. It''s a little <em>too </em>scaled back for the camera, but it''s the right idea.</p><p>The front 2.1MP camera is now cringingly called the ''selfie'' camera &ndash; it seems that dreaded word is here to stay, at least for a few years. The lens is a wider angle, so you can get more friends into the photo (or more actors at the Oscars) and features clever gesture recognition to take the photo.</p><p>Hold your hand out, make a fist and it''ll start the G3 self-portrait timer. It''s a clever system and it works, which is great for those moments when you can''t use both hands and don''t want to tap the screen.</p><p>Another cool feature is the ability to have a front-facing flash, although it''s not an LED light. Instead, part of the screen goes white, which illuminates faces and takes better pictures. LG has even white balanced this screen to correct skin tone imperfections &ndash; and it really gives some nice front facing snaps.</p> ', '', 'lgg3review2011-160-80.jpg', 'lgg3review205-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'With the LG G3, we''re seeing a brand release a phone ahead of time in order to grab a foothold', 'With the LG G3, we''re seeing a brand release a phone ahead of time in order to grab a foothold in an industry that could be spiralling away from its grasp.It''s an odd thing to say', '', 1, 3),

The bezels are distinctly chunky. Apart from that there''s a small cut away at the top where the speaker is and a pinhole for the microphone at the bottom left.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/back-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="ZTE Open C review"></figure></p><p>The right spine is home to a metallic-looking volume rocker. The left spine has nothing but a silver highlight strip. Up top we have the power button and the 3.5mm headphone jack, while the microUSB port is to be found on the bottom edge.</p><p>The back of the ZTE Open C has the camera lens (no flash), a small ZTE logo, and the legend "Firefox OS."</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/volumerocker-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="ZTE Open C review"></figure></p><p>It''s a chubby little fella, weighing in at 125g. It''s also taller than it really needs to be at 126mm because of those big bezels.</p><p>It measures 64.7mm across and those bevelled edges front and back, which taper into the slimming silver highlight strip, are trying to conceal a depth of 10.8mm.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sideinhand-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="ZTE Open C review"></figure></p><p>It takes a bit of effort to pop the back off and gain access to the battery, microSD card slot and SIM card slot, but nothing out of the ordinary. The Open C can support cards up to 32GB in size which is handy.</p><p>You will probably need a microSD card quite soon because there''s only 4GB of internal storage. On my review unit it seemed to be partitioned into 908MB for media storage and 989MB for applications.

Could things be about to change with the Xperia M2?</p><p>At first glance the Xperia M2 seems like a respectable proposition; a quad-core processor, 8MP camera and 4G LTE support, wrapped in a chassis that looks oddly familiar all for &pound;230 (about $385, AU$415) or free on two year contracts starting at around &pound;13 per month.</p><p>This means that the Sony handset has a tough fight on its hands, facing off against the newly relaunched 4G , as well as the ,  and the , all of which come in with a similarly low price tag.</p><p>The competition is fierce then, but with the same Sony Omnibalance design aesthetics that has graced its recent flagships the Xperia M2 certainly stands out.

But it''s staggering how small they seem when weighed against that double-take-inducing price tag.</p><p>A slight issue to get out of the way early on is the availability of this handset.

It''s far harder to make a solid, stylish, and hard-wearing mobile device than it is to throw in the latest off-the-shelf chip from Qualcomm.</p><p>However the OnePlus One is a pleasure to hold and to use.

It does mean that the aforementioned glass frontage appears to stand out rather than melding into the body of the phone, but it''s not an unpleasant effect.</p><p>All in all, it looks and feels like something of a cross between the Nexus 5 and the .</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/back-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="OnePlus One"></figure></p><p>The OnePlus One is not a particularly slim or light device, but then nor is it an absolute brick.

What''s more, the OnePlus One is three grams lighter than the Sony at 160g.</p><p>Of course, this is still a monster of a phone when you compare it to older or smaller devices. I always thought of my trusty old  as a bit of a beast, but the 4.7-inch phone feels positively dainty next to the OnePlus One. Meanwhile my iPhone 5S looked like a (rich) child''s toy when held next to it.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/with20iphone-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="OnePlus One"></figure></p><p>I''ve mentioned it a few times now, but the OnePlus One''s 5.5-inch display really is quite the specimen. At 5.5-inches it''s bigger than both the One M8''s and Galaxy S5''s, though it has the same 1920 x 1080 Full HD resolution. Admittedly that makes it a little less pixel-dense, but with 401ppi I defy anyone to call it anything but sharp.</p><p>If you''re thinking that OnePlus may have cut corners with the quality of this display, then think again. It''s an IPS display, which means it''s sharp and accurate even when viewed from an angle, and it''s made by JDI, the company responsible for the One M8''s excellent screen.</p><p>The default brightness seems a little weak, but crank it up and you''ll get a picture that truly pops, with impressively deep blacks.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/badlands-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Badlands"><figcaption>Badlands</figcaption></figure></p><p>Perhaps the best illustration of this is to boot up the gorgeous Badlands game with its inky-black silhouettes layered over detailed amber backgrounds.</p><p>It hasn''t been plain sailing for the OnePlus One''s display though, with a few users taking to the web complaining of a "yellow hue" at the bottom of the screen. OnePlus sent TechRadar two handsets, and having used both I can either that neither have suffered from this issue.</p><p>Around the back of the OnePlus One is the vaguely oblong black camera element that houses the lens and dual-LED flash.

Attach legs to the Cryo Libri Iceni and it could happily be described as a small coffee table. It weighs more than most efforts from IKEA too.</p>\n<p>None of this should be surprising as it''s so densely-packed with high-end PC technology we''re surprised it hasn''t started to collapse in on itself to form a computational singularity capable of instantly working out the answer to life, the universe and everything.</p>\n<p>There''s a magnificent selection of hardware inside: so much so we feel like kids in a sweet shop, not knowing quite where to start. It''s probably safest keeping those sticky fingers on the outside and taking a look at the vast chassis.</p>\n<p>It''s built around an 18.4-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 display. This gives it the large 440 x 300mm footprint, but its thickness ranges from 44mm up to 59mm and weighs in at 5.9Kg. This is no MacBook Air.</p>\n<p><strong>Touch controls </strong></p>\n<p>The Cryo also boasts illuminated touch controls, which you''ll either love or find a bit gourdy but they can be turned off.</p>\n<p>Under the machine you can see three 40mm cooling fans. While this might initially fill you with dread as you reach for the ear protectors, in our mind more fans makes for less noise, as they can all spin more slowly. But beside this the obvious fans, the stiff screen hinge, the gourdy controls all smacks of a level of design unsubtly; this really isn''t a MacBook Air.</p>\n<p>The screen is well sized at 18.4 inches and it has our preferred 1,920 x 1,080 resolution, presenting a suitably high pixel per inch ratio. It does have the usual laptop limitations of a poor vertical viewing angle, but the response rate for gaming is good.</p>\n<p>There are good reasons for this bulk beyond that screen. The most obvious is the pair of Nvidia GeForce GTX 285M graphics processors in SLI that sit inside, waiting to pump frame upon frame onto that 1080p screen. The first question that should spring to mind is: why the DirectX 10 hardware?</p>\n<p>For us this is a major turn-off for what otherwise should be a do-it-all system. Happily Cryo offers a CrossFire Radeon HD 5870 Mobility option for an additional £56.</p>\n<p>In performance terms these two SLI and CrossFire option closely exchange benchmarks but only the AMD option provides DirectX 11 goodness.</p>\n<p>Technicalities aside, the performance for what still passes as a laptop is astounding. The alternative Nvidia option would be to offer a SLI GTX 480M, but as we are yet to see such a model the SLI GTX 285M is currently the fastest mobile Nvidia option.</p>\n<p>As we suspected, the noise levels remained pleasingly low even under gaming loads, while the base also remained lap-level cool – though seriously, are you going to put this on your lap?</p>\n<p>It''s worth scouring the benchmarks below just to see how impressive the scores are, all the time reminding yourself that this is a laptop that''s rattling out those frames per second. We''ve said it before, but this is certainly no MacBook Air – you can play games on this beast.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/cryo-bench-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Cryo libri iceni" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Any green/red fan-boy should know that there''s little point popping a high-end dual-card graphics solution into a system without the processor power to back this up, otherwise the system will simply end up being CPU limited. So obviously Cryo has used – cue echo effect – the most powerful mobile Intel processor in the world – end echo effect.</p>\n<p>If that leaves you quizzical, it''s the undisputed king of the road: the Intel Core i7 940XM Extreme. It''s less the impressive 2.13GHz that it runs at and more the phenomenal Nehalem architecture built on the Clarksfield 45nm process that makes this a bitstomping colossus. With its four cores, eight threads via HyperThreading and Turbo mode going up to 3.33GHz, no matter if you''re throwing the latest multi-threaded tasks or single-threads at it, you''re going to get the best performance out of it.</p>\n<p>Helping all of this run smoothly is 4GB of dual-channel DDR3 memory, Corsair PC3-10666 memory to be more precise. While this is adequate and the system also ships with 64-bit Windows 7 Home Premium, we do think it''s somewhat stingy considering the outlay for two extra 4GB SODIMMs would have been around another £50.</p>\n<p><strong>Plenty of room </strong></p>\n<p>More pleasingly, the storage solution on the Cryo is a high-end delight. There are no less than three fixed hard drives, a 60GB boot Corsair SSD drive and then twin Western Digital 500GB drives combine into a RAID 0 for a total of 1TB of performance storage.</p>\n<p>The drives certainly don''t hang around, with the SSD returning an impressive 190.5MB/s average read, peaking at 250MB/s, while the spinning disk RAID averaged 103.6MB/s with peaks at 135MB/s. Of course the RAID was a factor of a hundred off with its seek times at 14.66ms, compared to the SSD result of 0.12ms.</p>\n<p>To round off the system there''s also a Blu-ray ROM slimline drive with the usual CD/DVD-RW capabilities. If movie entertainment is your thing there''s a HDMI out, plus HDMI in alongside DVI out. There''s a cable TV input and digital audio in/out.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/pcf248.wrev3.cryo21-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Cryo libri iceni" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Interestingly the laptop has built-in 5.1 audio – most manufacturers can''t build in two decent speakers, never mind six. While the sound was solid, we found the surround effect negligible and the centre speaker seemed somewhat pitiful, making us resort to the quadraphonic mode while the whole lot lacked any real volume, which left us wishing for simple decent stereo sound.</p>\n<p>Connectivity-wise there is USB 3.0 alongside USB 2.0 ports, eSATA, Firewire, infrared, Gigabit LAN and wireless-N.</p>\n<p>Hilariously there is a battery, which with 1080p playback lasted a smidgen over an hour and with <em>Far Cry 2</em> played a surprisingly long 50 minutes. But it''s effectively useless, providing not much more than cover in case the mains-cable is kicked out.</p>\n<p>Would we pay over £2,500 for this? Almost. Going back to the choice of Nvidia GeForce GTX 285M, which is a DirectX 10 part, you''d be better to simply walk away. The CrossFire Radeon HD 5870 Mobility model at just £56 more makes far more sense. Support for DirectX 11 really pushes it over the edge, but we''re not reviewing that.</p>\n<p>In the grand scheme of things, either model is actually excellent value. A similar Alienware system would set you back around £600 more, so for value-for-money Cryo has nailed it and delivered desktop-beating performance in a laptop, just not with DirectX 11.</p>\n<p class="webonly">Follow TechRadar Reviews on Twitter:</p>', '', 'pcf248.wrev3.cryo11-160-80.jpg', 'cryo-bench-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'This is trying to stretch the term ''laptop'' a little too far.

But the weight and general lack of bulk suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p>When all''s said and done, this is a out-and-out powerhouse of an entertainment laptop. There''s Bang and Olufsen ICEPower audio, 6GB of memory and a Blu-ray drive hidden inside that hefty case.</p>\n<p>Indeed, this is a high performance family laptop with a gaming bent – the high end Nvidia GeForce GT 555M has a whopping 2GB of memory on board just for graphics, providing some of the best 3D performance you''ll find in a laptop.</p>\n<p>While the chassis is big, it''s not as bulky as you''d think and is easily to move around the living room. Sadly the power brick isn''t so portable and is a bit of a lump. The chassis is a little plasticky, but is topped off by a lovely curved, glossy piano black lid with a smart looking chrome finish around the edge.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the lid does pick up fingerprints quickly, but that''s an issue with all such glossy laptop lids – particularly when they''re being used by kids. As a whole, the laptop looks very classy and we certainly wouldn''t be ashamed to leave it on the coffee table – the aluminium panel below the screen adds to this.</p>\n<p>The chassis has been put together well and is strong – you can''t push down on the palm rest, although there is a little flex in the base of the keyboard and the main laptop chassis itself. There is more flex in the screen, but it''s nothing out of the ordinary.</p>\n<h4>Key concern</h4>\n<p>We''re unsure about the keyboard though. It looks horrid compared to those of many comparable laptops, for a start. The letter keys seem a little compressed for such a large machine, and although they have a lovely spring to them when you''re typing, it''s easy to accidentally hit the wrong key.</p>\n<p>This problem is exacerbated by the location of the volume control keys on the left-hand side. It''s very easy to hit one of them when going for Tab or holding down shift – largely because we''re so used to these keys being at the edge of the keyboard. A bad usability flaw there; suddenly you see a volume control graphic pop up in front of you as you type.</p>\n<p>Sound, which has traditionally been a weakness for laptops, certainly isn''t neglected here. The B&amp;O audio is nothing short of astounding. It was too loud for our living room, so we really gave it a challenge by bringing it into the office. Even on the other side of our large open plan office we could clearly make out the music. It''s great for watching Blu-ray movies as a result, and HDMI means you can output your display to a larger screen.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to use the laptop''s built-in display, images are clear and crisp, and there''s an anti-glare coating to reduce reflections when you''re watching video or working. The screen has great contrast and colours are also reproduced well.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/wlt159.solo.asuslap-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Asus n55sf rear" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Photo, video and music addicts will be pleased with the 640GB of storage, and USB 3.0 connectivity means that, even if you decide to add external storage, transfer speeds would be extremely snappy with a USB 3.0 drive. Ports are plentiful, while there''s a SD card slot underneath the front lip.</p>\n<p>The trackpad is responsive, but we found the mouse buttons tended to click too easily and it can be difficult when doing more precise tasks such as highlighting text or files in a folder.</p>\n<h4>Powerful performer</h4>\n<p>The N55SF put in a really strong performance in our benchmarks – the gaming graphics put it right up alongside entertainment-orientated notebooks like the , as well as high-end gaming laptops such as the  and . With the quad-core processor, advanced graphics and 6GB of memory, you''ll have no trouble running most games or performing demanding tasks like video editing.</p>\n<p>The laptop uses Nvidia''s Optimus graphics switching technology, so you get great graphics performance when it''s plugged into the mains and decent battery life when it''s not. This is reflected in our battery benchmark score, which is great compared to many of its peers – the Toshiba''s Qosmio X770 only lasted 44 minutes by contrast.</p>\n<p>As with some other recent Asus laptops like the , we found some of the software annoying. A reminder to register our details constantly popped up, and an update wizard kept appearing. Such add-on software seems to be a way of life now, but it detracts from the out-of-box experience.</p>\n<p>That said, for extra unwanted software, the N55SF is better than most, with only the Bing toolbar really grating. And the benefit of the super-fast processor is that such additions don''t slow Windows 7 down.</p>\n<p>The N55SF is a superb home entertainment laptop with only a couple of weak points in the odd keyboard, mouse controls and some irritating software alerts. Performance is excellent and the spec sheet as a whole is impressive.</p>\n<p>Of course, all this doesn''t come cheap, but this machine compares extremely favourably to more stylised and costly entertainment laptops from the likes of Toshiba and Alienware. We''d definitely recommend it – if you can put up with the strange keyboard.</p>\n<p class="webonly">Follow TechRadar Reviews on Twitter:</p>', '', 'wlt159.solo.asus-160-80.jpg', 'wlt159.solo.asuslap-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'At first glance, it''s difficult to get a handle on exactly what type of laptop the Asus N55SF', 'At first glance, it''s difficult to get a handle on exactly what type of laptop the Asus N55SF is.

Dropping the "Plus" in its name, Samsung kept the same sleek, cobalt aluminum finish of its svelte 13-inch ultrabook. The company also squeezed another 0.6 inches out of its display, bumping it up to a 15.6-inch touch panel. However, the company knocked the Book 9''s resolution down a peg from last year''s 3200 x 1800 to a more standard 1920 x 1080.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ativbook92-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung ATIV Book 9 2014" /><figcaption>Just look at those curves</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>This is partly how Samsung can claim 14 hours of battery life on the Book 9, an impressive feat in endurance. Inside, you''ll find dual-core Intel Core i5 or i7 chips (Haswell, natch) with Intel HD Graphics 4400 and 8GB of RAM. As for storage, you have a choice between 128GB (for Core i5) and 256GB (for Core i7) solid-state drives.</p>\n<p>Samsung managed to come in at just 4 pounds while increasing the Book 9''s size, making it lighter and larger than Apple''s standard-setting . Sure, Samsung had to make one large conceit to get there, but more on that later. Now, let''s talk about a first that Samsung has made for the category.</p>\n<h3>The first lossless laptop</h3>\n<p>That''s right, audiophiles: The ATIV Book 9 is the first laptop with native lossless audio support. Playing up to 24-bit, 192kHz audio, this notebook can playback CD-quality (or lossless) audio files at their full bitrate.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ativbook95-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung ATIV Book 9 2014" /><figcaption>You could cut butter with this thing</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Sure, you music nuts might already have a home setup that plays lossless just fine, but do you have something on the road that can? That''s precisely the gap that Samsung wants to fill. Now, the size of the Book 9 speakers – tiny, if you''re asking – certainly plays a role.</p>\n<p>So, Samsung set up a demo with one of its new speakers to demonstrate, and the audio was crystal clear even over the din of the CES show floor. (Not to mention an on-stage demo going on right behind me.) Sure, lossless audio playback is a niche feature for folks that actually care about this sort of thing, but it''s a differentiator nonetheless.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ativbook98-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung ATIV Book 9 2014" /><figcaption>That''s how you use space</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>The crispness conundrum</h3>\n<p>About that display … Samsung opted to go with a standard, 1080p panel rather than keep the 3200 x 1800 screen at 15.6 inches. The reason? Battery life. There''s no way that Samsung could claim 14 hours of endurance with the Book 9 pushing that many pixels.</p>\n<p>Battery life has become one of the most important races in computing, with every year companies inching closer to the 12-hour mark during actual use. The ATIV Book 9 could very well be the first, at least in my experience; the MacBook Airs come in at about 9 to 10 hours.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ativbook93-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung ATIV Book 9 2014" /><figcaption>See? Doesn''t matter</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Now, here''s why bumping down the resolution doesn''t matter too much: Windows 8.1 isn''t even ready for QHD or UHD resolutions. Most vendors increase the default magnification anyway to compensate for the extra pixels, so what''s the point? I imagine Samsung asked itself the same question in crafting 2014''s ATIV Book 9, and erred on the side of right.</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>The Samsung ATIV Book 9 for 2014 isn''t a mind blowing revolution on the previous model, but it''s the smaller changes that make it an exciting rig. Coming in lighter than its main competitor and bumping up screen size is certainly no small feat for Samsung.</p>\n<p>And thanks to the size increase, Samsung was able to recess the keyboard deck for extra comfort and a more nuanced design. Three USB ports (with two being 3.0), HDMI out, mini VGA, an SD card reader and 720p webcam sweeten the deal. And frankly, I''ll take a hit in display resolution if it means a whopping 14 hours of battery life.</p>\n<p>With stylish details like chamfered edges and an all-aluminum body, you should expect to pay a premium, though Samsung has been mum on pricing. What you can expect is to see the ATIV Book 9 2014 to drop sometime in the middle of, well, 2014.</p>', '', 'ativbook97-160-80.jpg', 'ativbook95-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'Samsung doesn''t need to do too much to hold its position as one of the premiere laptop makers,', 'Samsung doesn''t need to do too much to hold its position as one of the premiere laptop makers, but it went ahead and did it anyway.

The Japanese giant may have produced some of the most desirable high-end machines out there, but its budget offerings have always been a mixed bag. Thankfully, using the Sony VAIO VPCEH2F1E is a reassuring experience.</p>\n<p>The keyboard and screen are both fantastic, and although the power tucked inside isn''t mind-blowing, it''s certainly enough for the vast majority of us.</p>\n<p>When it comes to appearance, the E Series is the ugly duckling of the VAIO family. It goes for the traditional all-black look (or white, pink or blue), but tries to mix it up with a textured triangle design that overlays the plastic. Questionable design aside, the chassis does feel remarkably firm and we couldn''t find any flex around the usual weak spots, such as above the DVD drive or around the screen hinges.</p>\n<p>The E Series models aren''t exactly light at 2.4kg, but you''ll easily be able to put this laptop in a backpack and carry it around for a day.</p>\n<p>The highlight of the E Series is definitely the firm, isolation-style keyboard. Even though this is a budget machine, Sony has installed highly usable keyboard that is a typist''s dream. There''s a great deal of space between the keys, as well as a dedicated numeric keypad and the three Assist, Web and VAIO hotkeys that Sony puts on all its models.</p>\n<p>Typing is particularly easy: the keys have a solid weight to them, and the added space means there''s no chance of a miss-hit. If we had to gripe, we''d say that the slightly raised keys could fall victim to dust, crumbs and other debris spilt over the chassis and that the touchpad is too small.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/wlt158.lbrev1.buildsony-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony vaio e series" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>This laptop''s screen is also worth touching on. It''s reasonably bright, and pictures came out clear and detailed – if a little whiter than others with darker displays. What we did like is that the screen runs almost to the edge of the lid, giving you the impression you''re looking at a screen larger than 15.6 inches.</p>\n<h4>Average power</h4>\n<p>It has to be said that you won''t be loading up the latest games, mixing high-definition video or doing a lot of visual programming on the VPCEH2F1E. However, the Core i3 processor is still a second-generation model and, as such, will allow you to multitask with different programs and easily handle less-intensive tasks, like audio mixing or basic programming.</p>\n<p>The keyboard will find favour with writers and the screen and speakers make watching movies a pleasant experience.</p>\n<p>If, after a year or so you decide to boost this E Series model with an extra monitor, or a better keyboard or more storage, you can do so thanks to the number of connections available. Connectivity includes four USB ports, HDMI, VGA and Ethernet connections, as well as an SD Card slot and a Pro Duo slot.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Sony has built-in 802.11n wireless and Bluetooth. While using the VPCEH2F1E heavily, we noted that it stayed both cool and quiet and that the battery gave us an average 173 minute life.</p>\n<p>It''s not hard to recommend the VPCEH2F1E as a good deal. It gets so many of the fundamentals right without feeling the need to shunt in excess power which adversely affects both battery life and price.</p>\n<p>It''s good to see a Sony VAIO laptop that the average person can afford and we have to say that, even if it''s not especially pretty, the this E Series laptop certainly gets the job done.</p>\n<p class="webonly">Follow TechRadar Reviews on Twitter:</p>', '', 'wlt158.lbrev1.073-160-80.jpg', 'wlt158.lbrev1.buildsony-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'We approach budget laptops from Sony with caution.

We would say that in a line-up, only the Dell Inspiron 14z looks better.</p>\n<p>Inside, the purple colouring is offset with Lenovo''s traditional black keyboard and several backlit hotkeys. Two rectangular speaker grills are present below the screen hinges which are themselves buried into the chassis.</p>\n<p>The 15.6-inch screen is covered with a Super-TFT coating for extra colour depth and isn''t interrupted by a particularly thick bezel.

It has a simple, clean design with plenty of storage space and powerful speakers. Unfortunately, a couple of underlying issues pull the overall experience down somewhat.</p>\n<p>Firstly, the grey and silver plastic design is nondescript. It looks much nicer on the inside of the laptop, though, offset against the black keyboard and screen bezel.</p>\n<p>As this is a 17-inch laptop, there''s lots of space to go around, and Acer accentuates this by putting a regular keyboard square in the middle of the chassis, adding a touchpad and leaving it at that.</p>\n<p>There are no hotkeys, no flashing lights and although it''s difficult to tell from the picture, the chassis feels expansive and spacious. All well and good, until you realise that the build quality (of the keyboard in particular) is pretty shabby. We felt quite a bit of flex around the edges of the chassis and the keyboard was practically bouncing up and down as we typed.</p>\n<p>The machine isn''t particularly heavy at 2.9kg, but since most people buying a 17-inch laptop aren''t looking for portability we''d be happy with a few extra grammes in exchange for a more solid build.</p>\n<p>While we''re on the subject, we''re going to assume most people buy a 17-inch laptop for the screen – be it to browse the web or watch a movie. The screen here is decent, complete with Super-TFT reflective coating, but the 1366 x 766 pixel resolution limits you to 720p HD content when, really, we''d quite fancy the full-blown effect of a 1920 x 1080 resolution.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the integrated Intel HD 3000 graphics card means the latest games and editing suite will have trouble running here.</p>\n<h4>Huge hard drive</h4>\n<p>If you want to put your media on the Aspire 7750 – high-definition or otherwise – you have a huge 720GB hard drive to fill up. If music is your thing, then the Dolby Advanced Audio speakers will go some way to convincing you this is the laptop to buy. You can get plenty of volume, but at no point does the audio become fuzzy or distorted – no mean feat for a laptop.</p>\n<p>General performance is no slouch either.

The textured, matt finish feels great and protects well against scuffs and scratches. Build quality is impressive throughout, with no flex in evidence on any of the panels. Even the thick screen is well put together and sure to withstand frequent family use.</p>\n<p>The keyboard is fixed well to the chassis and there''s almost no sign of flex when typing.

For a 15.6-inch laptop, the Erazer is quite the chubbster. At 2.7Kg and with a 37mm chassis, it''s heavy compared to other models of the same size, although it''s still compact enough to carry around without breaking your back in the process.</p>\n<p>The glossy black design means it looks cool, but is a magnet for our fingerprints and dust. The glossy design stretches over the touchpad too, which sits with a slight indentation beneath the keyboard so your fingers can find it easily.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the pad and keyboard have a cheap unreceptive clack and the individual keys are so loose in the chiclet array that we managed to get a couple caught underneath the casing. While typing is easy because the keys are isolated, we don''t hold out much hope for longevity before they break.</p>\n<h4>Excellent features</h4>\n<p>Fortunately, everything else is more than up to scratch. Four USB ports line the edges, with two at the super-fast 3.0 speed. VGA and HDMI connections fill out the right side, with nothing around the back and just a Blu-ray drive on the left. You also get a multi-format card reader, fingerprint scanner and a 1.3MP integrated web-cam.</p>\n<p>Audio was solid thanks to the Dolby Home Theater v4 HD audio, provided by two speakers and a subwoofer for reproducing the sort of low-end rumble that underpins movie or games soundtracks. It''s not going to set the world on fire and disintegrated into a cacophony with the volume up, but was resolutely serviceable for film and music.</p>\n<p>Medion did a great job by adding a Full HD 1080p screen.

Even if we didn''t use the Yoga as a tablet, we often flipped the keyboard back to poke through  live tiles or watch some Netflix.</p><p>What we didn''t like were mostly minor complaints. The keyboard, the trackpad, and the screen were all winners. The absence of a backlit keyboard was a mild annoyance, while the lack of a true 1080 display was a read missed opportunity. At the time, we also expressed concerns that the Yoga was actually exposing some of Windows 8''s weaknesses.</p><p>With the Yoga 2 Pro Lenovo produced a noteworthy refresh to a device that increasingly looks like it will be a mainstay of the PC maker''s lineup for the foreseeable future. A 3200 x 1800 display (known as QHD+, or WQXGA for the truly in the know) is the most significant enhancement, but the new hybrids also have a Haswell processor, some subtle enhancements to the chassis, and a few extra touches in the bundled software.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/straight20on-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo Yoga 2 pro review"></figure></p><p>All things considered, these are all welcome enhancements, although once again, Lenovo''s forward-thinking design exposes some surprising flaws in Windows 8''s ability to handle super HD resolutions on a portable form-factor.</p><p>What could possibly be bad about a QHD+ 3200 x 1800 display? We''ll get to that in good time. For now, let''s start at the top.</p><p>One final note before we dive in: there aren''t a great number of competitors in the super high-resolution ultrabook category. The  is one&mdash;it sports near-identical specifications to the Yoga 2&mdash;and the 13-inch MacBook Pro is another. Both cost 40% to 50% more than this system.</p><h3>Sleek, modern&hellip;and versatile</h3><p>As the saying goes, you don''t fix what isn''t broken. In addition to its unprecedented flexibility, the original Yoga''s sleek, rubberized chassis was one of the laptop''s most remarked-upon attributes. Thinking clearly, Lenovo has changed barely a thing, aesthetically speaking.</p><p>Part of the joy of reviewing this new Yoga Pro 2 was putting it in people''s hands. Everyone remarked on its nice it look and feel, thanks to a thin profile, sturdy chassis, and that grippy, rubberized surface that we mentioned, which coats the entire device.</p><p>Just like last year, the most striking and still unique aspect of the Yoga 2 Pro is the fact that you can flip the screen back 360 degrees until it rests flat against the backside of the keyboard. This permits four operating modes.</p><p>Laptop mode is your standard 90-degree angle, with the advantage that the Yoga 2 Pro''s flexible hinge allows you to lay the screen completely flat, which is actually quite handy for situations where you''re standing up and need access to the keyboard.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/tent20mode-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo Yoga 2 pro review"></figure></p><p>The most useful mode next to laptop mode would be tent mode. By setting the tablet on its top and bottom edges, the devices functions like a tablet in a stand. The new rubberized bevel edges earn their keep in this mode. The old Yoga would sometimes slide a bit on slippery surfaces. Not anymore. It''s perfect for glancing at a recipe while cooking or setting the Yoga 2 Pro up on cluttered tablet tops.</p><p>Stand mode is essentially tent mode, but with a little more sturdiness and support. The key difference is that it has a bigger footprint, so you''ll need to clear off more of your desk before touchdown.</p><p>A special hinge on the Yoga 2 allows you to fold the screen all the way back for tablet mode. Unfortunately, just like the original Yoga, the 13-inch Yoga 2 Pro is a little too large to use comfortably in tablet mode. Also a repeat of the original: the presence of the keyboard on the backside of said tablet is obstructive and annoying. This said, the notion of playing full-fledged, touch-optimized PC games like Civilization V in this mode is fairly joyous, even if the device is too heavy to hold in your hands.</p> ', '', 'flippin-160-80.jpg', 'straight20on-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'Lenovo has been breaking ground in the convertible ultrabook world with its Yoga line.

HP is doubling down on this design with the EliteBook Revolve 810 G2 for business users, announced during  in Barcelona, Spain.</p>\n<p>Little, if anything, is different about the EliteBook Revolve''s design. The big picture here is what HP has changed on the inside of this convertible laptop. Intel''s Haswell has become the de facto standard chip, and the EliteBook Revolve follows suit.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/hp-elitebook-revolve-g21-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HP EliteBook Revolve 810 G2" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Design and specifications</h3>\n<p>Users will still enjoy the sturdy and attractive magnesium alloy shell and Gorilla Glass screen covering the 11.6-inch, anti-glare UWVA LCD. However, that the panel on the EliteBook Revolve is still set to 1366 x 768 resolution is a bummer, especially considering the $1,364US/$1,499EU starting price. (We''re still waiting on UK pricing and availability.) Competing convertible laptops, like Lenovo''s ThinkPad Yoga, come sporting 1080p for the same or less.</p>\n<p>Of course, the swivel-hinged screen is the star of the show, transforming this 22.2mm thin and 1400g laptop into a Windows 8 Pro-equipped tablet at a moment''s notice. HP includes a hefty stylus with every EliteBook Revolve. During our brief time with the stylus, it proved accurate, and the screen was more than snappy and responsive enough to the index finger. What''s worse is that there is still nowhere to store the stylus on the device -- we''d trade this in for a smaller pen if it meant room to store it in the chassis after use.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/hp-elitebook-revolve-g27-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HP EliteBook Revolve 810 G2" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>As for the ultimate input, HP''s spill-resistant, backlit (optional) chiclet keyboard remains unchanged, with a clever drain system to get rid of moisture quickly. In a quick test, we noticed a bit of flex in the center of the keyboard, but nothing that would be noticeable in everyday use. The single-button touchpad remains the same as well, and all the standard Windows 8 gestures worked swimmingly.</p>\n<p>But again, what this EliteBook Revolve revision is all about is the inside. Business folk should be excited that the second generation can house up to a dual-core, 2.1GHz Intel Core i7 4600U CPU with Intel HD Graphics 4400. Backing that are up to a whopping 12GB of DDR3 RAM at 1,600MHz and an SSD as spacious as 256GB. The priciest configuration would make for one seriously snappy convertible laptop, but would surely be overkill.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/hp-elitebook-revolve-g23-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HP EliteBook Revolve 810 G2" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Rounding out those specs are 802.11 a/b/g/n Wi-Fi connectivity and Bluetooth 4.0 as an option. A 4G LTE radio is also on offer, if you''re willing to pay extra. And HP brought its A-game when it comes to I/O, with two USB 3.0 (one with charging capability), an RJ-45 port, DisplayPort, headphone/microphone combo jack, a side docking connector and a microSD card reader.</p>\n<h3>Spin me right round</h3>\n<p>The swivel-hinge approach to the hybrid laptop design is one of the more elegant solutions around for the form factor. It''s easy to appreciate the disappearing keyboard without having to detach and put it down somewhere else. The super responsive, capacitive multitouch screen certainly helps the EliteBook Revolve make its case as a tablet, too.</p>\n<p>That said, the swivel hinge still fails to solve the dilemma all convertible laptops face: While 22.2mm and 1400g make for quite a thin and light laptop, it makes for a rather plump tablet. A thinner stylus that you could store within the convertible laptop shell would be helpful, especially to creative professionals. But we''re already talking about a rather small audience that might already be using Wacom tablets in the office and iPads on the go.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/hp-elitebook-revolve-g22-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HP EliteBook Revolve 810 G2" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>The HP EliteBook Revolve 810 G2 takes the old adage, "If it ain''t broke, don''t fix it," to heart -- perhaps a little too close. Little has changed here in terms of design, and that''s a good thing, though it still doesn''t surmount hybrid laptops'' biggest hurdle.</p>\n<p>Aside from hopping onto Haswell and adding room for tons of RAM, this convertible laptop hasn''t changed enough on the inside, either.

According to the company, the EliteBook Folio 1040 G1 is 16.1 percent thinner and 7.3 percent lighter than the previous EliteBook. And with a full magnesium alloy finish in a deep gray hue from its lid to its spill-resistant, island-style matte keyboard, this  is quite the looker.</p>\n<p>And so is that display, a 1920 x 1080 UWVA, anti-glare panel.

While the unit we handled did not include a touchscreen, the option will be there when the latest EliteBook Folio becomes available later this December starting at $1,299US/$1,799EU. (We''re still waiting on UK pricing and availability.)</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/hp-elitebook-folio-1040-g14-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HP EliteBook Folio 1040 G1" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>As for function, HP can pack the EliteBook Folio with up to a dual core, 2.1GHz Intel Core i7 4650U CPU with Intel HD Graphics 5000 and backed by as much as 8GB of DDR3 RAM at 1,600MHz. An SSD as large as 256GB will accompany those powerful innards. Of course, 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi comes standard, but Bluetooth 4.0 and 4G LTE are available as well , if you so desire. Finally, a fingerprint reader comes optional for those willing to pay up for peace of mind.</p>\n<p>With just two USB 3.0 ports, a DisplayPort, headphone/microphone combo jack, a 3-in-1 card reader and a side docking connector, the EliteBook Folio is victim to its own svelte form factor. Yet, this ultrabook manages to one-up the MacBook Air, which lacks docking capability altogether.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/hp-elitebook-folio-1040-g15-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HP EliteBook Folio 1040 G1" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Feel the Force</h3>\n<p>HP''s attempt to meet form and function comes through most in the EliteBook Folio''s ForcePad. This Synaptics-built touchpad eschews the mechanical click of most single-button touchpads and instead uses four pressure-sensitive sensors under the capacitive sensor array. The result is impressive, albeit unnecessary, in HP''s first-ever go at the technology.</p>\n<p>Increasing pressure in any direction on the right side of the touchpad -- rather than glide two fingers -- to scroll displayed pinpoint accuracy. And applying pressure to an icon for simple "click and drag" gestures was a breeze. The ForcePad will evoke some "oohs" and "ahhs", but this new approach brings a learning curve. It simply feels strange to press down and feel nothing, despite Synaptics''s audible "click" that comes from the speakers whenever pressure is applied. Artists and creative professionals might appreciate the ForcePad. But touchpads are fine the way they are, especially for the enterprise crowd.</p>\n<p>HP promises "all-day battery life" from the EliteBook Folio, which will be the true test of whether this ultrabook offers the best of both worlds. With a Haswell chip and SSD on its side, the EliteBook Folio could very well deliver. And perhaps by that time, the Force(Pad) will grow stronger on us.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/hp-elitebook-folio-1040-g16-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HP EliteBook Folio 1040 G1" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>At first glance, the EliteBook Folio 1040 G1 is one gorgeous workhorse, with its magnesium enclosure super slim profile. Once you get your hands on it, it''s clear that this ultrabook means business, especially with its fresh ForcePad tech.</p>\n<p>While the ForcePad is impressive, we''re still on the fence about whether this touchpad approach adds anything to the computing experience. Plus, that the EliteBook Folio''s gorgeous 1080p, UWVA display isn''t standard (base configurations start with a 1600 x 900 SVA panel) is a bummer.</p>\n<p>HP''s promise of "all-day battery life" doesn''t mean much right now, but already pits this $1,299 laptop against the MacBook Air and Samsung .

In theory, it''s Haswell, in a tablet, with a low power draw!</p><p>The idea is that you can still have the slim and light tablet chassis, but without the frequently tedious performance of the Lenovo Miix 10 or the . It''s designed to go up against the Microsoft Surface Pro 2, rather than the low-end tablets.</p><p>And, indeed, the VAIO Tap 11 is nicely thin and light.

There''s 4GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD, a USB 3.0 port, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0, a micro-HDMI port and microSD card reader, NFC and front and rear cameras.</p><p>It also comes with a keyboard, much like many of its kind (though you still have to buy the Surface Pro''s keyboard separately&hellip;), which doubles as a screen protector for when you travel. It''s a very thin add-on, though it weighs almost as much as the tablet itself. It''s wireless, and charges itself from the VAIO Tap 11 when it''s connected to the front of the tablet magnetically. There''s no other way to charge it, so if it gives up while you''re working, you''ll just have to&hellip; stop working.</p><p>There''s also a powered stylus, which works with a digitizer in the screen to give you precision touch control and drawing. Both the keyboard and the stylus don''t need setting up at all &ndash; just turn them on and they''ll work, which is handy.</p><p>Sony is keen to point out the creative potential of the tablet, giving it a glorious 1920x1080 screen for detailed drawing. The screen is only 11.6 inches, so it''s lovely and sharp.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/tap-11205-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony VAIO Tap 11"><figcaption>The screen is a nice glossy one</figcaption></figure></p><p>From the front, the VAIO Tap 11 is a looker, with a glossy black front, and a smart bezel surrounding the screen. As with most Windows tablets, the idea of using it portrait mode has been pretty much abandoned, with a rear kickstand combining with the Sony logo and positioning of the Windows Start button on the front to indicate that you should just use it in landscape.</p><p>The Start button is quite annoying, because it''s a quite resistive physical button rather than a touch-sensitive one, and if the tablet is standing using its kickstand you''ll need to use two hands to stop it slipping around when pressing it.</p><p>It''s a shame that the smart front is slightly marred by the connection for the keyboard to charge in the bottom corner, but it''s not the only less desirably build element of the Tap 11.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/tap-11209-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony VAIO Tap 11"><figcaption>Some poor finishing, especially around flaps</figcaption></figure></p><p>The edges of the unit fit together well enough, but wherever there''s an opening or flap they''re incredibly poorly finished, with port covers not seating properly and rough, pointy corners around holes for the headphone jack or power cable.</p><p>The back is mostly just plain plastic, but you''ll find speakers here, as well as a flip-out stand.

It''s designed to allow the Tap 11 to provide capabilities closer to the , but in a package more like the thinner regular .</p><p>The chip used here is the Intel Core i5-4210Y. It''s a dual-core chip, based on Intel''s most up-to-date designs known as . As we said, other low-power Windows 8 machines, such as the , use Intel Atom processors, which are built differently, and optimised for lower energy consumption, with processing power suffering considerably as a result.</p><p>The Core i5-4210Y is an attempt to get better performing chips down to levels of power that will allow for something closer to the battery life of the iPad 4 without losing the fuller capabilities of Windows. Intel is suggesting that in some light-use scenarios, the chip could use just six Watts of power, which is around a third of the maximum power used by the higher performance Haswell ultraportable chips in the latest .</p><h3>Max power</h3><p>However, when you look at the maximum power used by the 4210Y, under heavy load, it''s around 75% as power-hungry as the more powerful chips. We''ll probably have to wait until  to see this kind of thing reach its potential, but if the technology is currently capable of giving the Tap 11 a nice long battery life for more basic use, it could be very useful here.</p><p>The dual-core 4210Y features Intel''s HyperThreading technology, offering a boost in some operations, and is clocked at 1.5GHz, with Turbo Boost taking that up to 1.9GHz when possible.</p><p>It''s no surprise to see that the graphics in the VAIO Tap 11 are of the integrated variety from Intel. The Intel HD 4200 is the lowest-end of Intel''s graphics range for Haswell chips, which helps in keeping power use low, but means that it''s a significant drop off in power compared to even the graphics in the MacBook Air.</p><p>However, Intel has continued to improve its graphics chip designs in Haswell, and the difference between what''s in the VAIO Tap 11 and what''s in Atom-powered tablets such as the Samsung ATIV Smart PC is vast.</p><h3>Few surprises</h3><p>Elsewhere, the VAIO Tap 11 carries few surprises, but that includes nothing nasty when it comes to specs.</p><p>The 4GB of RAM is plenty for most uses. It''s not great for high-end graphics work, but should be fine for some photo editing, and is more than enough for home use or working on documents.</p><p>The 128GB SSD should keep sleep and wake times to a minimum, though the amount of free space really isn''t huge &ndash; you''ll have something like 50GB available to use for storage and programs. There is a microSD card slot for some additional storage space, at least.</p><p>As we said, there''s 11.6-inch, 1920x1080 screen, which is the sort of thing we''d expect for a tablet at this price. The micro-HDMI port enables you to connect larger screens, too.</p><p>The standard USB 3.0 port is a nice addition, and it''s good to see Bluetooth 4.0 included, allowing for low-power Bluetooth accessories to connect. The Wi-Fi is 802.11b/g/n, meaning that the fastest current protocol, 802.11ac, isn''t included, but that''s no surprise, and it''s not really necessary for a tablet.</p> ', '', 'tap-11201-160-80.jpg', 'tap-11209-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'Every month, it feels like the gap between tablets and laptops is getting smaller &ndash; or at', 'Every month, it feels like the gap between tablets and laptops is getting smaller &ndash; or at least, it feels like a new company is trying to make it smaller.

As a third option, detach the tablet part of the device and the dock can act as a fully-fledged Windows 8 desktop PC on its own when connected to an external VGA or HDMI monitor.</p><p>This means you can use the tablet in Android mode at the same time as using the dock connected up to an external monitor in Windows 8 mode. Theoretically, at least, it opens up the doors to some nifty remote desktop-based action. Say you''ve got a meeting - for example - you could use the device as a laptop, detach the tablet, fire up TeamViewer or RealVNC and carry on viewing the contents on your external monitor on the Trio''s PC Station.</p><p>One caveat of all of this is that the tablet can''t be used in Windows 8 mode when detached as it automatically switches back to Android.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/android-in-hand-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Asus Transformer Book Trio"></figure></p><p>Switching between the two operating systems is as simple as pressing what Asus dubs the ''Trio'' key, which is located on the top-right hand side of the keyboard. The actual switch is almost instant, taking around a second at the most. It holds a unique appeal if you can''t be without your Android apps on a tablet and need the functionality of full-fat Windows 8.1.</p><h3>Design and specs</h3><p>The Trio sports a sharp 11.6-inch IPS display (1920 x 1080) that impresses with vibrant colours and deep blacks, which look particularly alluring when the tablet''s running in Android mode.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/tio-windows-8-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Asus Transformer Book Trio"></figure></p><p>We were a little less enamoured with the black bezel surrounding the screen, which is a little too chunky for our tastes. It also picks up a fair few fingerprints, as would be expected on a reflective display of this type, but they were easy enough to wipe off.</p><p>As a tablet, the Transformer Book Trio is an 11.6-inch tablet that''s powered by a dual-core Atom Z2560 CPU clocked at 1.6GHz. At 1.5lbs, it''s light to hold, coming in fractionally heavier than Apple''s iPad 2 (1.33lbs).</p><p>Unfortunately, that ultra level of portability stops in its tracks once the keyboard dock is attached, which isn''t surprising as it houses the Trio''s internal grunt. If you were to prise it open, you would discover a fourth-generation Intel Core i5 Haswell processor, a 64GB SSD, 4GB of RAM and a 500GB HDD.</p><p>Connecting the dock makes the device thicker and heavier, bulking up from 9.7mm at its thickest point to 13mm and going from 1.54lbs to 2.2lbs, putting it on a par with Apple''s 11-inch MacBook Air (2.38lbs).

Other features include an accelerometer, ambient light sensor, gyroscope and e-compass.</p><h3>Keyboard and dock</h3><p>The Asus Transformer Book Trio''s chiclet keyboard isn''t the best or worst we''ve ever used, meaning it isn''t likely to win any awards in this category. There''s decent spacing between the keys themselves, but they lack travel and feel a little rigid to type on.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/keyboard-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Asus Transformer Book Trio"></figure></p><p>A button to switch between Windows 8 and Android is housed on the top right-hand side of the keyboard next to the F12 key.

The first is cost. This is an expensive device and you may find yourself asking whether you''d be better off going to get a more standard Windows Ultrabook and topping that up with a reasonably priced Android tablet. </p><p>The second big compromise is in terms of weight.

Squarely targeting small business owners and more basic use cases, the S431 is a simple machine, but like many Lenovo rigs these days, it packs a solid amount of power and versatility under the hood.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/thinkpad-9-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad S431 Touch review"></figure></p><p>Relatively speaking, $949 for this system is a solid deal, particularly in light of the performance, which blows away the tier immediately below the S431 Touch, and competes favorably with the price tier just above it.</p><p>Lenovo calls the S431 an ultrabook, and on a technical level, we''d agree. With a touchscreen, a slim profile, and sensible power/performance ratios, it does qualify for this category. However, after using the system in everyday fashion for a full week and a half, calling this device an ultrabook feels like it is selling it short. We''ll call it a premium ultrabook instead.</p><h3>Basic black kit 2.0</h3><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/thinkpad-1-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="ThinkPad S431 Touch review"></figure></p><p>On the surface, there is nothing particularly flashy or striking about the ThinkPad. Stark, black, and serious-looking, the S431 upholds a fine ThinkPad tradition dating all the way back to 1992. </p><p>We''ll say this much: in a land populated by all kinds of colorful, chromed-out, and flashy systems, it''s actually quite refreshing to carry around this sleek, simple-looking system. Other people clearly feel this way too. We received a number of questions and comments from ThinkPad fans asking us what exactly we were carrying. And when people saw the ThinkPad logo, they were excited.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/thinkpad-13-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad S431 Touch review"></figure></p><p>The big difference is the S431''s slim profile and its slightly glossy look and feel, which is a departure from the matte-finish ThinkPad of yesteryear. Made of sand-blasted aluminum on a magnesium frame, the chassis itself has a slightly shiny surface, with the ThinkPad logo prominently displayed in the bottom right-hand corner of the system. Like other modern ThinkPad portables, the "I" on the logo lights up when it''s operating.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/thinkpad-3-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="ThinkPad S431 Touch review"></figure></p><p>Thanks to the lightweight-but-sturdy magnesium chassis, this laptop feels more substantial and solid than most consumer systems. Measuring 13.11 x 8.8 x .8-inches, it''s surprisingly thin, and at 4.1 pounds, it doesn''t tip the scales. It''s not as light as we hoped, but at the same time, it is certainly not a burden to carry around. At least the sturdy, solid feeling at least justifies the weight.</p><p>If you haven''t seen a Thinkpad in a while, you may be comforted and/or surprised to see the familiar presence of the red dot thumbstick between the G, H, and B keys. The keyboard itself utilizes modern, Chiclet-style keys. We confess that, initially, the clickpad, which exhibits a surprising amount of travel on downward mouse presses, concerned us. We were worried that over time, it would feel too boggy for rapid-fire, day to day use.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/thinkpad-2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="ThinkPad S431 Touch review"></figure></p><p>Both feel phenomenal, by the way&mdash;but we''ll get into that a little later in this review. </p><p>Finally, we absolutely love that you can lay the laptop flat at a 180-degree angle. Not that we''d do that very often, but it means that during stand-up meetings, you can push the screen back far enough that everyone can look at it. Given the screen''s sub-par viewing angles, this is important. </p> ', '', 'thinkpad20s43120hero-160-80.jpg', 'thinkpad-9-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'Lenovo isn''t the number one PC manufacturer on the planet by chance.

On paper, it''s got the gaming chops to handle almost anything you can throw at it.</p><p>That means a powerful quad-core Intel processor and a beefy discrete graphics chip from Nvidia, namely the GeForce GTX 770M. Of course, there''s more to being a great gaming laptop than simply speedy silicon.</p><p>You''ll need a decent screen, for starters. The Medion''s weighs in at a monster 17.3 inches and full 1080p in terms of resolution. There''s also a high-power sound system including a subwoofer, a Blu-ray drive and 750GB of storage for games, videos and more.</p><p>Of course, a gaming laptop needs to be half decent at being just, well, a laptop, too. In an ideal world, you''d have enough battery life for genuine mains-free usability. A few movies on a flight, that sort of thing.</p><p>You also want to cover all the bases in terms of networking, connectivity, card reading and all that jazz. So let''s see how the Medion Erazer X7825 stacks up.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc07883-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Medion"><figcaption>It''s a big old beast, but that comes with the territory</figcaption></figure></p><h3>Performance</h3><p><strong>Benchmarks</strong><br>Cinebench R11.5: 6.71pts<br>x264 4.0 HD video encode: 35fps<br>3D Mark Firestrike: 3,043pts<br>Heaven 3D tesselation benchmark: 25fps<br>Metro Last Light: 14fps<br>GRID 2: 38fps</p><p>Let''s kick off with the CPU side of things. Medion has gone for an Intel Core i7-4700MQ. It''s a 2.4GHz nominal, 3.4GHz Turbo quad-core chip. And it''s really all the CPU you''re ever going to need for gaming.</p><p>And that despite the fact that this chassis appears to have a few issues keeping it cool. During heavy CPU loads, the cooling system makes one hell of a clatter. </p><p>What''s more, maintain a sustained heavy CPU load and you find the clocks dropping off a little. Set something heavily threaded running and it will initially zip along at 3.2GHz. But within a minute or so, the clocks drop and fluctuate between 2.9GHz and 3GHz.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc07868-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Medion"><figcaption>Connectivity includes multi-channel sound and severl USB 3.0 ports</figcaption></figure></p><p>However, the reality is that this is still one hell of a beefy CPU for a portable system. On the graphics side we''re talking Nvidia GeForce GTX 770M with 3GB of memory.</p><p>As ever with mobile GPUs, the branding is misleading. This is not a 1,536-shader graphics solution based on the GK104 chip, as is the case for the desktop GTX 770. Instead, it sports 960 shaders courtesy of GK106.</p><p>That''s no necessarily a major issue. It would just help anyone choosing a laptop if the branding was more consistent. Whatever, the 770M is a decent gaming chip. Middle-ranking games, in terms of graphical fidelity, like GRID 2 bowl along at a decent speed at the display''s native 1,920 by 1,080 pixel resolution, even with the image quality set to maximum.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc07881-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Medion"><figcaption>Sub woofer boosted audio packs a punch, but isn''t exactly high fidelity</figcaption></figure></p><p>Fire something serious demanding up, for instance Metro Last Light, and you''ll have to makes a few compromises on the IQ settings to get smooth frame rates.</p><p>But what of the quality of the screen itself? We''ve seen worse, is probably the best way to put it. We like the matte screen coating. Glossy coatings add little to the experience other than annoying reflections. </p><p>Likewise, the basic panel attributes, including viewing angles, colour saturation and fidelity, contrast and all that jazz are decent. OK, it''s a good TN panel rather a really exceptional IPS display. But we have no major complaints re display quality.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0789420copy-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Medion"><figcaption>It''s no high end IPS panel, but viewing angles and contrast are respectable</figcaption></figure></p><p>The sound levels from the sub-woofer boosted audio system and strong, too, even if the actual quality is a little muddy and mediocre. Few laptops offers truly satisfying sound, so this is hardly a shock.</p><p>If all that sounds pretty promising, the Medion Erazer does have at least one major weakness. And that''s storage performance. We were surprised and frankly a little concerned to discover a 750GB magnetic drive as its sole source of built-in storage.</p><p>And our worries proved well founded. Storage performance is atrocious. You feel it installing games. You feel it when Windows applies updates, which take aeons to install. You even feel when simply firing up fairly undemanding apps.</p><p>In the past, this was unavoidable. Fast hard drives couldn''t fit into laptop systems. But that all changed years ago when SSDs arrived and allowed laptops to match desktops for storage performance. Put simply, this laptop is crying out for a solid-state drive.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc07876-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Medion"><figcaption>Full-sized keyboard is sturdy and reasonably tactile</figcaption></figure></p><p>As for battery life, three hours and 13 minutes playing 720p video with the wireless disabled and the screen at one-third brightness isn''t as catastrophic as some gaming laptops. But it still means you''re essentially limited to one movie on the move.</p><p>One final issue worthy of note involves the graphics setup. The Intel CPU provides a low-power graphics core, which offers a low-power option when running on batteries.</p><p>That''s great, but by default, the Medion is set to run all 3D applications on the Intel core, even when plugged into the mains. That''s not great and it will cause some buyers a great deal of confusion. Because games will still run on the integrated Intel core.

The carbon weave pattern wraps the laptop''s body, giving it a futuristic look more common on sports cars and stealth fighter jets.</p><p>The entire machine iscoated with a thin, rubbery substance that enhances grip when carting it around in hand.

Panasonic has long been the known commodity when it comes to field-ready laptops and tablets. But Dell looks to keep its rivals on their toes with "the industry''s first rugged convertible laptop," the Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme.</p>\n<p>This bulging behemoth of a laptop-tablet hybrid is designed for use in several high-impact fields, namely police work, emergency response and in the military. That''s why Dell made sure that this Latitude meets several military specifications for field use – MIL-STD-810G, IEC 60529 (IP-65), MIL-STD-461F, and ANSI/ISA.12.12.01, if you''re keeping score.</p>\n<h3>Designed to last</h3>\n<p>In other words, this laptop is extremely resistant to water, dust, cold, heat – thanks to its isolated "QuadCool" cooling system – and more. Dell claims that the Latitude 12 can withstand repeated drops from as high as 6 feet. And speaking of water resistance, I poured an entire bottle of water on its bigger brother, the Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme, and it continued to press on. Both devices have drainage ducts to thank for that.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/delllatitude12rugged-7-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>But Dell is also concerned with providing rugged laptops that are just as tough on the inside. So, the Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme can be equipped with one of Intel''s 4th generation CPUs and optional discrete graphics. You can also spec a ruggedized Latitude 12 with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of solid-state storage.</p>\n<p>On the outside, the Latitude 12 comes sporting Dell''s "RGB" backlit keyboard, which features several color options, namely those visible from behind nightvision goggles. The machine''s HD webcam comes with a privacy shutter, for security reasons, and is joined by an 8-MP shooter (with flash) around back.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/delllatitude12rugged-6-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>All of this comes wrapped in a magnesium alloy frame bolstered by ultra-polymer plastic and sealed doors around its ports (including USB 3.0 and native serial connections). Naturally, all of this hardware together doesn''t come cheap – $3,649 (about £2,194, starting from AU$4,999), to be exact.</p>\n<h3>A tough-as-nails touchscreen</h3>\n<p>One of the first questions I had for a Dell representative at the event was, "How does the touchscreen work under wet conditions?" To ensure that rain and snow would be of no concern for folks on the field, Dell packed the Latitude 12 with a resistive touchscreen. "Resistive" means that the panel relies on pressure to detect your touch rather than electrostatic conduction from your bare fingers.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/delllatitude12rugged-9-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>This means that the screen works with gloves, and to great effect, as I was able to test the panel with covered hands in an (admittedly freezing) ice bar recently. However, I also noticed that the  Modern UI blurred significantly as I swiped back and forth. I''m told that this may have been a bug, and the unsightly blur will not be in sight upon release.</p>\n<p>That said, colors popped on the display, which Dell dubs a "Direct-View" panel with increased outdoor readability, since it relies less on backlighting. Dell says this helps the Latitude 12 claim 8 hours and 30 minutes of battery life.</p>\n<h3>Perhaps too hard of a hybrid?</h3>\n<p>If you''re wondering how Dell got a hybrid device to work while still meeting rugged specifications, the answer is the XPS line, believe it or not. Dell used the same swivel hinge technology found in its premium leisure laptops, but upped the rigidity to match the desired mil-spec certifications.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/delllatitude12rugged-8-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>But perhaps Dell went a bit too firm: switching between tablet and laptop modes was tough to manage one-handed, not to mention opening the clamshell lid in the first place. This isn''t a swap you''re going to make on the fly. And good luck holding the device in one hand and using the touchscreen with the other.</p>\n<p>But maybe that''s the point: This looks like a laptop that you''ll have to try to break. And that''s what you should want from something you''re spending tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on for your squad.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/delllatitude12rugged-5-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>The Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme is an impressive machine, demonstrably ready to take a beating … and a splashing … and a dusting. Plus, this new model''s docking mechanisms are compatible with all previous Rugged Extreme docks, making deployment simpler and more affordable.</p>\n<p>But given issues like the intense blur when using the resistive touchscreen, it looks like Dell still has a bit of work to do before this ruggedized hybrid is ready to hit the battlefield. By May 6, when this squad-ready laptop-tablet hybrid will launch, my bigger concern would be whether the Latitude 12''s weighty tablet mode will work for users in the heat of the moment.

It''s exceptionally powerful and particularly portable, squeezing a Haswell-based Intel Core i7 processor, an Nvidia Quadro graphics card, up to 16GB of memory and both an SSD and hard disk into a chassis that''s just 18mm thick and weighs 1.8kg.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1020042-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="top"></figure></p><p>What''s more, the high-end M3800 variants come with a 3200x1800 QHD+ display, a resolution with higher pixels-per-inch (PPI) than Apple''s MacBook Pro with Retina Display. At super-high resolutions like this, text and graphics are rendered with a noticeable crispness that makes rich content such as web pages look stunning. To cap it off, the 15.6-inch glossy screen is 10-point multi-touch capable too.</p><p>And as a further endorsement, the M3800 looks fantastic. The slim design complements the silver-grey aluminium cover, with precisely cut curves and edges that give the laptop an unmistakably professional look, but certainly not a dull one. A rubbery material surrounds the keyboard, which is exceptionally comfortable when typing, but may not stand up well to rough use.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1020043-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="edge"></figure></p><p>The keyboard is chiclet-style, with well-sized keys for accurate typing. There''s a giant trackpad, which can be tapped or clicked, but no physical buttons. With Dell''s own software loaded in the System Tray, the trackpad can recognise multi-touch gestures, so dragging two fingers down scrolls through a web page.</p><p>Dell''s site offers surprisingly few customisation options. All M3800 variants come with a 2.2GHz Core i7 4702HQ quad-core processor, which runs at 3.2GHz in Turbo mode and Quadro K1100M graphics card with 2GB of memory, which goes alongside the integrated Intel HD 4600. Likewise, all models come with a built-in twin-antenna Intel 802.11ac wireless adaptor. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1020047-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="corner"></figure></p><p>The M3800 we reviewed came with a 256GB LiteOn SSD, and a 500GB hybrid hard disk, which combines a small amount of flash memory with a conventional disk for speedy access times. A 512GB SSD is available in the most high-end model.</p><p>If you opt for a less-expensive M3800, you get a 1080p-resolution display rather than the QHD+ one, as well as less memory, and only a hard disk without the SSD. </p><p>At the top of the screen is a 720p webcam, plus two microphones for stereo audio. To our ears, the speaker quality is great for a laptop, but as ever an external sound system is recommended for serious music enjoyment. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1020048-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="on end"></figure></p><p>What you won''t find is an optical drive or Ethernet port. If you want wired networking, Dell has included a USB-to-Ethernet cable in the accessories box, while the Windows 8.1 recovery files are on a USB stick. Given the M3800''s thin design, there is a generous selection of ports at the side. There''s HDMI 1.4 and DisplayPort video output, three USB 3 ports, a USB 2 port and a card reader.</p><h3>Performance</h3><p>You might think desktop performance from a slim laptop is an exaggeration, but that''s just about what Intel''s top-end Haswell mobile processors can manage. CPU benchmark results were within 10 percent of those measured on a desktop computer with Intel''s 3.5GHz Core i7 3770k for comparison. The M3800 scores 6.36 in Cinebench 11.5, not far off the desktop''s 6.8. In 3DS Max, a detailed render that took just over 20 minutes on the desktop took 22 minutes on the Dell M3800. A great result.</p><p>The specification of the Quadro K1100M closely matches Nvidia''s slightly older mid-range K2000M mobile GPU. One of the big differences with the newer card is a 45W power consumption, compared with 55W before, making it easier for Dell to squeeze into the M3800''s thin chassis.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1020054-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="corner"></figure></p><p>In tests this card performed very well, with 42.14 fps in the Cinebench OpenGL test and a 3DMark Vantage score of p8170, far better than most laptops of this size. In professional graphics benchmark SPECviewperf 11, it''s outclassed by Nvidia''s beefier Quadro K3000M and above GPUs. </p><p>But these cards draw more power and require additional cooling, meaning their inclusion would have necessitated a larger chassis. The Quadro supports Cuda as well, so Cuda-accelerated software such as Adobe After Effects should receive a further performance boost with the card when enabled.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1020057-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="upside down"></figure></p><p>The Intel 7260 wireless adaptor didn''t fair so well. Tested with a Western Digital AC1300 wireless router, we measured 38MB/s transfer rates, from a distance of one metre. Reasonable, but 802.11ac can be quicker than that, when used with a three-antenna receiver.</p><p>Likewise, the MSATA SSD didn''t produce record-breaking transfer rates. 436MB/s read and 384MB/s write speeds are alright, but from its 4KQD32 write speeds in CrystalDiskMark, we calculated the SSD offers 70,000 IOPS. Not as high as Samsung''s high-end Evo drives, for example.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1020063-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="top"></figure></p><p>But despite less-than-perfect wireless and storage speeds, the M3800''s hardware is tantalisingly attractive. Although there are no expansion bays, you can easily add a new SSD or upgrade the hard disk by undoing some Torx screws on the carbon-fibre base. The combination of excellent performance, high-DPI display and thin design are one of the best in a Windows laptop. Except for a few problems.</p><p>For text and graphics to appear at normal sizes on the exceptionally high resolution QHD+ display, they need to be drawn at a higher DPI than on lower resolutions, In Modern UI, this all happens automatically, and in Windows 8.1, the DPI is automatically set, so all title bars, menus and text on the Windows desktop look normal.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1020068-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="keys"></figure></p><p>But load some third-party software and there''s a high chance the fonts and graphics will be so small, the application will be unusable.</p><p>Adobe CS6 and Creative Cloud applications are one notable example. The menu titles are unreadable and each icon occupies less than a millimetre of screen space. There are plenty of other examples that cropped up during testing, and it will take a while before the issue is fully addressed by Microsoft and software vendors.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1020072-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="open edge"></figure></p><p>This is hugely disappointing, given that the M3800''s performance is just the sort of thing graphic designers want from a portable system. Lowering the desktop resolution is one solution, which renders the high-DPI display pointless, and while you could opt for the cheaper 1080p model instead, the variants available on Dell''s site don''t offer all the bells and whistles of those that come equipped with the models sporting a QHD+ display.</p><p>The other problem is battery life. An estimated two hours, nine minutes in PCMark08 is pretty weak, and a video playback test with Avatar in VLC saw the battery conk out after two hours 58 minutes, right when the end credits began.</p><h3>Verdict</h3><p>The Dell Precision M3800 is a great laptop with superb desktop-like processor performance, a powerful GPU and a truly gorgeous thin-and-light design that we think has a real edge over the majority of laptops on the market today. Although there are more powerful laptops with faster graphics cards, these are much bigger and heavier, necessary due to the cooling and energy requirements of hefty GPUs.</p><h3>We liked</h3><p>The high-end quad-core Core i7 4702HQ processor is key to the impressive benchmark results clocked up by the M3800. The Nvidia Quadro K1100M is likewise a sturdy professional GPU that will run all types of 3D software and offer a helping hand when running intensive tasks with design tools that support Cuda.</p><p>Its sleek looks, tough build, thin frame and light weight all make the M3800 an attractive, desirable technology item that justifies its considerable price. It''s handy, too, that the innards are relatively accessible, so users can perform limited upgrades.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1020070-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="top"></figure></p><p>The keyboard is great for typing, and Dell should be commended for adding Mac-style gestures to the trackpad software.</p><p>Likewise the QHD+ display is beautiful, and removes even the slightest hint of any pixellation from text and graphics. At least, when software has been written to adhere to the DPI setting in Windows.</p><h3>We disliked</h3><p>The battery life was really bad, even with the Quadro disabled in Nvidia Control Panel. It stands to reason that thin, light and powerful is a combination that''s tough to get right, and battery life was the sacrifice that Dell made to achieve the laptop''s thin design.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1020064-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="wedge"></figure></p><p>But the Windows DPI problem is a bigger issue that will currently affect any laptop with a display greater than 1080p. We hope the issue is sorted in Windows 9, and Microsoft talks with application vendors to ensure software looks right in every desktop resolution.</p><p>And while the lack of optical drive and Ethernet port is understandable, relying on external accessories means having to remember to pack them in a laptop bag when travelling.</p><h3>Final Verdict</h3><p>These problems prevent us from declaring the Dell Precision M3800 the last word in mobile workstations. They very much affect the overall experience of using it, and even if you don''t regularly use software that refuses to play nicely with high-DPI displays, you''ll still encounter the issue now and then.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1020075-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="detail"></figure></p><p>In all other respects though, the Dell Precision M3800 is brilliant. The only thin mobile workstation that rivals its performance, with a discrete graphics card, is the  although it''s not as thin and only has a dual-core processor, not a quad-core. </p><p>If you can live with its quirks, the M3800 is still one of the best Windows laptops available and something we truly enjoyed using.</p> ', '', '1122.m3800-160-80.jpg', 'p1020042-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'The promise of using an Ultrabook-sized computer for serious design work has never really come', 'The promise of using an Ultrabook-sized computer for serious design work has never really come to fruition, because until recently, mobile workstations have been a compromise between portability', '', 2, 3);

As a reminder, both come with an octo-core Samsung Exynos processor, possibly the Exynos 5410, which has four Cortex-A15 and four Cortex-A7 subprocessors in the dynamically scaling CPU configuration known as big.LITTLE. The A15 subprocessors are clocked at 1.9GHz on the 11-inch model and at 2.1GHz on the 13-inch one.</p>\n<p>Apart from size and keyboard layout, the other major difference is screen resolution: the 11-inch model spans 1,366x768 pixels while the bigger Chromebook has a full HD resolution which falls short of Google''s high-end  but is still significantly higher than the rest of the competition.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsungchromebook2-3-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Chromebook 2" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>That particular model was not working properly which meant that we couldn''t visually compare the screen quality on both Chromebooks. Expect the 13-inch model to be marginally sharper as it boosts a higher pixel density (170 vs 142ppi).</p>\n<h3>Hangout certified</h3>\n<p>These new Chromebooks are also the first to get an official Google Hangout certification. This means that Samsung has equipped both of them with dual array microphones, a 720p HD webcam and video processing capabilities.</p>\n<p>The rest of the specs read as follows: 4GB of RAM, 16GB onboard storage, a webcam, HDMI port, two USB ports, a SD card slot and PowerVR graphics.</p>\n<p>Battery life is rated at eight hours on the smaller Chromebook and slightly higher for the larger one. The model on the booth however showed only six hours capacity when fully charged.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/samsungchromebook2-4-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Keyboard" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Compared to the original Chromebook, the ports have been moved to the sides and the chassis has been modified with a larger touchpad.</p>\n<p>The keyboard appears to be the only major letdown. The keys, while reasonably well spaced, were far too loose for our liking. Put it this way, we could hear the keys rattle when we shook the Chromebook (not that this is something you''d do often).</p>\n<h3>Matte plastic</h3>\n<p>The overall finish of both laptops is what you''d expect from a comparable entry-level, Windows-based laptop with matte plastic being the main material used in the chassis.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, the 11-inch model is thicker than its bigger counterpart (16.8mm vs 16.5mm) although lighter (1.2Kg and 1.4 Kg respectively).</p>\n<p>Perhaps as a sign of the Windows-isation of the platform (pardon the neologism), Samsung also bundled a number of Chrome apps, in a way similar to how PC manufacturers bundle ''bloatware''.</p>\n<p>That said, two of them at least, Wunderlist Pro and Airdroid, are genuinely useful for both business and consumer users.</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>My encounter with the Chromebook 2 was brief and underwhelming. The faux-leather back is purely aesthetic and adds nothing to the functionality. Other than the extra onboard memory and the upgraded system-on-chip, there''s no major improvement to the 11in model.

It also scored 3GB GDDR5, a kick up from the 765M''s 2GB GDDR5 VRAM.</p>\n<p>According to Razer, the new Blade scored 65% faster than its predecessor in the 3DMark 2011 benchmark. During a game demo, the average frames per second landed at 55.4.</p>\n<p>The processor continues along the 4th gen Core i7 path, and combined we found the new Razer torched through tasks. Perhaps a little too hot.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0010-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="scorching" /><figcaption>Lovely keyboard, if only a tad toasty</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>A Razer engineer explained that the company identified a "no touch zone" along the top edge of the laptop''s base (right above the F1 - F12 keys, where users'' fingers typically don''t wonder) that helps disperse heat generated by the supped-up specs.</p>\n<p>While this region definitely heated up, the heat seeped as low as the J and K keys on my right and D and F keys to the left. It wasn''t burning, but was uncomfortable enough for me to question how long I''d want to let my fingers linger on those letters.</p>\n<p>The whir of the fans was also noticeable, something we didn''t identify as a problem in our 2013 review. To be fair, the laptop we checked out had been running for at least 30 minutes, performing various game demos and being subjected to my hands on, so it may have reached a boiling point of sorts. TechRadar will have to perform more long-term testing to see how the new Blade holds up during regular use.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0025-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Port" /><figcaption>It may be thin, but the 2014 Blade has the important ports</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>As for the rest of the notable parts, the trackpad moves the cursor at the slightest provocation, so be warned if you''re sensitive to overly responsive pads. The Blade''s speakers, given an extra boost by Dolby, are excellent.</p>\n<p>The laptop features three USB 3.0 ports and HDMI 1.4a audio and video output. With 8GB of on-board memory and a starting SSD of 128GB, the Blade packs plenty of space for games, work and whatever else you want to store.</p>\n<p>It''s worth mentioning the built-in 70 watt-hour battery and 150 W power adapter, which is probably one of the smallest I''ve seen. The 70 Wh gets a shout out because Razer managed to squeeze it in a 0.7-inch thick frame.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0007-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Razer" /><figcaption>Small details, like the ridges along the top, make the Blade stand out</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Finally, the Blade''s black clamshell case is a standout design element. It''s sleek and attractive and feels great to the touch. It gives the laptop a bit of flare and carries that distinct Razer look.</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>When Razer introduced the Blade last year, it set out to redefine the gaming laptop. It wanted to prove a powerful machine doesn''t have to mean a bulky one.</p>\n<p>Razer''s first go succeeded in meshing mobility with function. With its new Blade, Razer has stayed true to that philosophy while still finding ways to improve. The screen is worlds better than the original and I can''t imagine other gaming laptop makers - hell, any laptop maker - ignoring what Razer has put in the Blade.</p>\n<p>It''s not just a pretty face though and Nvidia''s new GPU was impressive during my short time seeing it in action.</p>\n<p>The biggest hang-up for many will likely be the Blade''s price, which starting at $2,199 (about £1,323, AU$2,451) is $100 (about £60, AU$111) less than the first Blade when it went on sale but significantly more than Apple''s MacBook Pros with Retina, save for the 15-inch 2.3GHz configuration.</p>\n<p>Still, it''s a lot of laptop for the buck, and a beautiful one at that. Gazing at a gasp-worthy screen while you game may just be worth the price of admission.</p>', '', 'new20razer20screen-160-80.jpg', 'dsc0010-580-100.jpg', NULL, 'There''s something gratifying about a company keying in on customer complaints and attempting to,', 'There''s something gratifying about a company keying in on customer complaints and attempting to, if not making, amends on the next version of a product.Not that the first 14-inch  was a', '29/07/2014', 2, 3),

Power comes from a combination of a current-generation Intel Core i5 processor and discrete Nvidia graphics core, and those headline components are backed up by a decent specification elsewhere &ndash; plenty of RAM, a large hard disk and good connectivity.</p><p>Toshiba isn''t usually a firm that takes risks with the physical design of its laptops, and that''s certainly the case here. The Satellite M50 is a good-looking machine, but there''s little new about the layer of brushed aluminium that''s used to coat much of this machine, or the glossy black bezel that surrounds the 15.6in screen &ndash; and the panel''s resolution of 1,366 x 768 isn''t exactly going to set pulses racing, either.</p><p>This versatile mid-range machine has plenty of competition.

It''s a part hewn from Intel''s latest Haswell architecture, and this 22nm chip has a respectable specification that includes a 1.6GHz standard clock, a Turbo Boost peak of 2.6GHz, and two Hyper-Threaded cores. It''s the same processor as in the Toshiba Satellite U50t, and a better-sounding proposition than the low-power AMD A6 parts inside the Samsung and Asus laptops &ndash; although it may face a stiffer test when up against the Lenovo''s beefy AMD A10 APU. </p><p>The graphics core, like the processor, is a current-generation part &ndash; at least in name, if not in architecture. Nvidia''s GeForce GT 740M uses the GK107 core that did the rounds in last year''s range of 600-Series mobile GPUs, and here it has 384 stream processors clocked to 810MHz alongside 2GB of dedicated GDDR5 memory. It sounds more powerful than the integrated Intel and Radeon chips inside three of its rivals, although the Lenovo''s AMD A10 graphics might give the GeForce silicon a scare.</p><p>Elsewhere, there''s 6GB of DDR3 memory and a 750GB hard disk. That''s plenty of storage capacity, but we''re not exactly expecting great speed from that drive &ndash; it spins at just 5,400rpm. If you''re after pace, the Samsung has an SSD, although its capacity is restricted to just 120GB.</p><p>Connectivity includes dual-band 802.11n Wi-Fi, Gigabit Ethernet and Bluetooth 4.0. The Ethernet port sits on the right-hand edge along with two USB 3 connections and an HDMI output, and the Toshiba''s left-hand side houses a USB 2 connection, audio jack and SD card reader. It''s an acceptable port selection, although Toshiba has omitted a VGA output. There''s no room for a DVD writer either &ndash; a disappointing omission that, at least, brings the M50 in line with Ultrabooks.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/satellite20m50-a15-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba Satellite M50-A-11C"><figcaption>Plastic, with aluminium over the top</figcaption></figure></p><p>The M50''s chassis is made largely from plastic, with a thin layer of brushed aluminium used to add a touch of class to the lid and the interior.

Instead, Sony is selling the brand, with plans to put more focus on mobile. Sony cites a changing desktop landscape &ndash; unmistakably due to the radically different Windows 8.</p><p>The Vaio Fit 11A is an attempt to address consumers'' changing notebook demands, but it''s also a reminder why Sony is leaving this business. Consumers want notebooks and they also want tablets, but do they want them together? Is there a single computer experience that can satiate customers'' desire to have it all?</p><p>The Fit 11A is certainly a solid go at it. But is it worth your money?</p><h3>Design</h3><p>The biggest thing that makes the 11A unique is that its display can flip 360 degrees, making the entire device a large tablet. To show off this crafty transformation ability, the notebook has a large black crevice that runs horizontally on top of the aluminum lid when the notebook is closed. Aside from that line, there are only small Sony and Vaio logos on the lid, which provide pleasantly subtle branding.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyvaiofit11a-2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Vaio Fit 11A review"></figure></p><p>Lifting the lid reveals a traditional laptop, with a full QWERTY keyboard slightly recessed into the plastic deck. Unfortunately, this keyboard leaves a lot to be desired. The key travel length is quite stunted and the 11-inch form factor means the keys are uncomfortably cramped. Although I had mostly gotten used to the size of the keyboard by the end of my week with the notebook, I was overjoyed to get back on a full-size keyboard when I was done.</p><p>The clickpad is centered below the keyboard and &ndash; at 4.5 x 2.5 inches &ndash; provides plenty of room for moving around and performing Windows 8 gestures. I never had any issues swiping in from the right in order to open the Charms menu, or swiping in from the left to cycle through open applications.</p><p>On the hinge that connects the deck to the display, there is a small switch that unlocks the screen so that it can flip around into tablet mode. There are small magnets that hold the display in place when facing either direction, which gives each mode a pleasantly secure feel. When the lid is locked in notebook mode, everything feels tight and secure.</p><h3>Makes for a tacky tablet</h3><p>It''s obvious that Sony understands that people like to use tablets, but the 11A in tablet mode is proof that they don''t understand why people want to use tablets. The 11.6-inch widescreen display is superbly awkward in portrait mode and &ndash; while movies looked great &ndash; the unit was too heavy to comfortably prop up the laying back on the couch. And forget using it with just one hand.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyvaiofit11a-5-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Vaio Fit 11A review"><figcaption>Kind of bulky, don''t you think?</figcaption></figure></p><p>Not to mention, the 11A looks like an unwieldy beast in tablet mode, especially when compared to the Lenovo Yoga 11S, which lays nice and flat when the screen is flipped all the way around. The 11A forms a slightly wedge-shaped tablet, with the display also not lining up flush with the top of the tablet. The flexibility was nice when I propped it on a table, like the Lenovo Yoga''s stand mode, but I wished I could simply detach the screen from the keyboard like the Asus Transformer Book TX300.</p><p>One of the oddest design choices is the inclusion of a camera &hellip; on the bottom of the notebook. It makes sense when compared to other tablets, most of which have a rear-facing camera, but looks odd and out of place on the 11A. Flipping the device over and seeing a tiny camera lens, centered between two rubber non-slip pads, makes it seem like a device suffering from identity issues.</p><h3>Power, Interrupted</h3><p>By far the worst design offense for me is Sony''s easy-release power cable connector. The concept is valiant: create a plug that won''t pull the notebook off the table if you trip over the cord. But the execution drove me crazy. It never feels like it''s ever really connected &ndash; the cord is constantly wobbly, making you second guess whether you actually put the right plug in the right port.</p><p>And it disconnects way too easily. Almost every time I picked up the notebook, the plug would simply drop out.

Where the Y510p weighed 5.95 pounds and measured 1.41 inches thick, the Y50 comes in at just 4.7 pounds (5.7 pounds with optional touchscreen) and 0.94 inches.

(Not to mention that it puts the  2880 x 1800 pixels to shame.) The Y50 might need the best Nvidia GTX chip to run games at 4K resolution, but the sheer fact that it''s even possible in such a thin laptop is nothing to sneeze at.</p>\n<p>Marquee PC game releases like Battlefield 4 already support that many pixels, while the  and  have yet to show off games in 4K.

More UHD PC games are likely to come in 2014, so good on Lenovo for jumping ahead on that one.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovoy50-5-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo Y50" /><figcaption>An illuminated power button – classy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>That said, it''s not clear whether a single GTX graphics chip could run games at 4K resolution and decent settings. (The most recent demos have shown Battlefield 4 in 4K running on four Nvidia GTX Titan GPUs.) For now, all we have is hope and the fact that Lenovo can say "first!" to its competitors in a comment thread somewhere.</p>\n<h3>Looks aren''t everything, but…</h3>\n<p>Apple will say that hardware design is as important as what components you can cram inside a machine, and Lenovo seems to agree. For one, Lenovo has gave the Y50 the same iconic, crimson keyboard lighting as its Y510p. It''s a bummer that this, too, does not come standard.</p>\n<p>Another dig on Lenovo''s trademark AccuType keyboard: It was extremely squishy this time around and showed too much flex. I''m told that the models on show during CES 2014 were prototypes, so hopefully this changes for the better in the final product. The matte plastic touchpad, however, was as smooth and snappy as ever.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovoy50-4-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo Y50" /><figcaption>Will that drive bay truly be missed?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Regardless, the Y50 will look good doing your bidding, with a slim, angular all-black silhouette. Lenovo claims that it achieved this thinness through better thermal engineering, but losing a few component options along the way undoubtedly helped. This rig will feel great, too, with a cross-hatch aluminum finish on its lid and a matte, metallic surface on the keyboard deck.</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>Lenovo made good use of every last inch of the Y50''s frame, slapping a subwoofer on the bottom of the device to support its JBL speakers up top under stark red grilles. That comes through in the connectivity on offer as well, from USB 3.0, HDMI-out and a media card reader to Bluetooth 4.0, optional 802.11ac Wi-Fi and a 720p webcam.</p>\n<p>The Y50 is said to last up to 4 hours all things considered, though I doubt you''ll get that much playing games at 4K resolution. At any rate, the Lenovo Y50 is a sight for sore eyes – literally. However, the keyboard needs some work and some sacrifices were made to get under an inch of thinness. Not to mention that many of its key features don''t come standard.</p>\n<p>Regardless, I''m excited to see what this gaming laptop can do, especially in the UHD gaming department.

The keys don''t have enough travel, but that''s not a huge problem: they''re heavy and consistent enough to provide solid feedback without feeling too weighty, and the base is strong. We quickly got up to speed &ndash; an improvement on most of the other systems mentioned here, which combined low-travel keys with flimsy bases.</p><p>Little stands out about the trackpad &ndash; its surface is fine and the two buttons are light and clicky, although they feel a little too cheap for our tastes.</p> ', '', 'toshiba-s50d-160-80.jpg', 'top-down-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'Toshiba is a reliable choice if you''re looking for a solid mid-range laptop, and the S50D-A-10G', 'Toshiba is a reliable choice if you''re looking for a solid mid-range laptop, and the S50D-A-10G aims to continue that tradition with a tempting price of &pound;480 (around US$820, AUD$870).

Falcon Northwest, Asus, MSI, and Maingear all come to mind, but Origin PC is garnering major attention with its EON line. The company is better known for building made-to-order gaming PCs with fully assembled water-cooling blocks. But those who know the origin story will remember this gaming boutique was started by ex-employees of the top-end gaming laptop maker, Alienware.</p><p>It''s been a few years since Origin first got into the game and this time around, its EON17-S is loaded to the gills with a 17.3-inch 1920 x 1080 resolution screen, Onkyo-designed speakers, and a multi-colored LED keyboard&mdash;and that''s all standard. For this particular review, Origin sent TechRadar a machine loaded up with an absurd 8GB of video RAM onboard an Nvidia GeForce GTX 880M graphics card and nearly the most powerful Intel Core i7 chip.</p><p>The EON17-S has some impressive specs behind it that should translate to near desktop-level performance. However, given this machine''s considerable footprint, it''s more of a command deck than a laptop.

When closed, the laptop only has a few bits of noticeable flair on its back lid, including a metal Origin logo and two flared lines. This makes the machine resemble a Lamborghini, thanks to the red rubberized lid. This hypercar look extends to the back of the machine, where there are two massive vents that look like they were pulled right off of an Aventador or Gallardo.</p><p>Otherwise the laptop does not feature any side-paneling lighting on the side or superfluous "body armor," like the Alienware 17. Instead, the EON17-S is a fairly pedestrian machine with an almost all-plastic body, unlike the brushed aluminum-bodied MSI GS70. Despite its plasticky frame, the Origin machine feels dense and there''s only the slightest hint of flex in the middle of the keyboard.</p><p>Opening the clamshell reveals more of the EON17-S'' accented stylings, including a completely backlit keyboard plus a trackpad emblazoned with Origin''s logo. To make things more comfortable, the rubberized coat from the lid also covers the keyboard deck and wrist pads. Just above the function keys is a built-in equalizer that lights up in the presence of loud music and explosions. This includes sounds piping through the EON17-S'' audio outputs or speaker bar, which nearly spans the entire width of the laptop.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/origin20eon17-s20review20speaker-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Origin EON17-S review"></figure></p><h3>Spectacular sound</h3><p>Getting deeper into the EON17-S'' unique speaker system, it''s way bigger and louder than most built-in laptop sound systems.

It''s also great for users looking to turn this 17.3-inch laptop into a makeshift media center.</p><p>Ultimately, using a headset is best for gaming, but customers emptying their bank account for the EON17-S can rely on the laptop''s built-in speakers.

Measuring 23mm at its thickest point, its body tapers toward the bottom making it appear thinner.</p><p>The black bezel surrounding the screen is eye-catching; not only is it thinner than what you would find on a MacBook Pro, it''s part matte and part glossy which makes it a little more interesting to look at too.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kira-table-1-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Kira"></figure></p><p>The lid and base are coated in an attractive silver finish that''s complimented by a shiny silver lining around the power button - which turns blue when activated, along with an orange Wi-Fi indicator - and trackpad. </p><p>Sure enough, the Kira is a very good (but not quite great)-looking machine that curiously loses appeal when the lid is closed. A silver Toshiba logo adorns its bottom left-hand corner, and its opposing square and rounded corners contrast effectively, but there''s nothing here that screams premium.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kira-from-above-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Kira from Above"></figure></p><p>Build quality is decent overall thanks to the Kira''s magnesium alloy construction that uses a honeycomb structure. You''ll only notice the flex on the underside of the base if you actively go prodding it, but the lid is worryingly bendable to the point that you''ll want to avoid using it to pick the machine up. </p><p>Thankfully the hinge is sturdy enough to prevent the lid from wobbling, so you''ll only have to touch the lid when opening and closing it - an act that takes two hands - one to prise it open and the other to hold the base steady. Four rubber feet on each corner of the base keep the machine sturdy when you''re typing.</p><h3>Display</h3><p>Though it was more of a standout feature on last year''s version, the Kira''s 13.3-inch WQHD (Wide Quad High Definition) PixelPure display still makes for impressive viewing, with high contrast levels that show off its deep blacks and solid colours.</p><p>The high quality of the display is partly because it''s an IGZO (indium gallium zinc oxide) variant, the same type that''s used in the iPad Air, which allows for higher pixel densities by using smaller semiconductor components.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kira-front-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba Kira"></figure></p><p>It''s far from perfect though: despite its solid color reproduction, the panel''s image quality is hampered by a dim backlight, which maxes out at what feels like around 85% brightness. It''s made worse by the display''s highly reflective nature, which makes viewing its contents awkward in places like our brightly lit office - or outdoors.</p><p>The display features 10-point multi-touch, which is responsive and accurate. It may be questionable whether you would need touch on a non-hybrid model (especially for the added cost), but it certainly allows you to perform some tasks faster than using a trackpad or mouse.</p><p>The panel is made of Corning Concore glass, a type of glass designed for touch-sensitive panels that should protect against drops and scrapes.</p><h3>Keyboard, trackpad and speakers</h3><p>Despite feeling quite compact for a 13-inch Ultrabook (mainly thanks to the thin bezel), the Kira doesn''t provide a cramped typing experience. However, that''s not helped by the fact that its chiclet-style keyboard keys aren''t completely square; they''re slightly wider than they are tall, which may take some adjusting.</p><p>A little more annoying is the small shift button on the left-hand side of the keyboard.

It''s 15.5mm (0.61 inches) thick and weighs 1.4 kg (3.08 pounds). The Core i7 4500U runs at 1.8 GHz, with a maximum turbo frequency of 3 GHz, and the graphics are handled by an integrated Intel HD 4400 graphics processor.

Mini DisplayPort, micro HDMI, Two USB 3.0, an SD card reader and an audio jack occupy the sides, along with the power connector.</p>\n<p>When held, the Asus Zenbook UX301LA is bulkier than you might expect. The glass surface on the lid feels pleasant but shows up fingerprints wherever it''s touched. For this reason, a micro-fibre cleaning cloth and non-alcoholic fluid would definitely make a great companion purchase and it seems Asus may have missed a trick by not including something similar in the stylish packaging that accompanies the Zenbook UX301LA.</p>\n<p>The main section of the laptop feels strong – I pushed it quite hard and didn''t notice even the tiniest amount of flexing, but the screen easily bends under comparatively little pressure.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/asusux301la-9-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Asus Zenbook UX301LA" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The trackpad has a generous amount of space, but no physical buttons. Instead, left and right clicking can be done by pressing at the bottom, and there''s custom software to allow for gestures, such as swiping to go back in a web page, and scrolling up and down with two fingers. These work excellently, and can all be customised in the software. However, one shortcut becomes highly irritating: swiping at the side of the trackpad to switch between desktop and  Modern UI application. It''s very easy to do this accidentally, and is best disabled.</p>\n<p>Compounding the issue with fingerprints on the lid is the glossy display. Touch-sensitive laptops have a substrate layer that requires them to have a glossy screen, but it''s seems especially noticeable in the Asus Zenbook UX301LA, perhaps because the dark casing highlights the reflections more than a lightly-coloured chassis might.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p>A critical issue currently facing PC laptop designers is the use of high-resolution screens in small displays, when text in Windows and third-party applications appears too small to see. With the Windows desktop DPI set to default, a full HD resolution on a 13.3in screen is really pushing the boundary of usability, so I''d really hate to see what the 2560 x 1440 variant looked like.</p>\n<p>Windows 8.1 automatically adjusts the desktop DPI, which makes text legible and improves usability a lot. It has to be done manually with vanilla Windows 8 or Windows 7 though, so raising the DPI setting is the very first thing I''d do on any laptop with a high resolution screen, which includes the Asus Zenbook UX301LA, which arrived with Windows 8.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/asusux301la-7-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Asus Zenbook UX301LA" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>But as with other laptops I''ve tested, not all third-party applications adhere to the DPI settings, and remain at their standard size with tiny text, an issue for which there is no current solution.</p>\n<p>Since there''s no PC version of Apple''s proprietary PCI-Express storage connector it now uses in its computers, designers have to be creative to boost SSD performance beyond the limits of the SATA interface. But using two SSDs in Raid 0 can offer mixed performance, especially since Sandisk SSDs, as found in the Asus Zenbook UX301LA, aren''t the fastest around.</p>\n<h3>Benchmarks</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>3DMark</strong>: Ice Storm: 52,285; Cloud Gate: 5,151; Fire Strike: 693</li>\n    <li><strong>Cinebench 15</strong>: CPU: 240 points; GPU: 22.6 fps</li>\n    <li><strong>PCMark 8 Home</strong>: 2,421</li>\n    <li><strong>PCMark 8 Battery Life</strong>: 5 hours and 32 minutes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having two of them provides some hefty burst transfer speeds: 981 MB/s when reading data and 586 MB/s writing. But overall SSD performance is affected by more than just burst data transfer. Other results, such as a random 4K write result of 233.7 MB/s are indicative of worse overall IOPS performance than some high-end single SSD.</p>\n<p>CPU performance was as expected from a low-voltage processor.

Although boot times were fast, switching between Modern UI and the Windows desktop wasn''t quite as instantaneous as I''m used to. A few times, resuming from sleep took longer than I''d like as well. I loaded up an 1080p encoded rip of Avatar, and had absolutely no problems with playback.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/asusux301la-4-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Asus Zenbook UX301LA" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>I tested the battery life by playing this file looped in Windows Media Player, with the screen brightness set to 120 cd/m2. On a full charge, it lasted well into the third play of the film, conking out after six hours 45 minutes, enough time to be really tortured by Avatar''s dreadful script and plot. The PCMark 08 battery life test wasn''t as good though, lasting five hours 32 minutes.</p>\n<p>The Cinebench 15 OpenGL result of 22.6 points to limited gaming performance.

The latest from the Round Rock, Texas firm is the Dell Inspiron 11 3000 Series, a rethink of the smallest model in its entry-level laptop line.</p>\n<p>Unlike most notebooks in the Inspiron range, the Inspiron 11 3000 is a laptop-tablet hybrid, or what Dell calls a 2-in-1 device. It''s easy to think of this as Dell''s answer to the ; its 11.6-inch, 1366 x 768 IPS touchscreen even flips 360 degrees just like it.</p>\n<p>The idea behind the Inspiron 11 3000 isn''t all that different, either: to offer a versatile computing device to students on a budget. Not to mention in a form factor that can at least try to make a bit more sense as a tablet.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dellinspiron113000-5-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Inspiron 11 3000 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Everyone''s doing the Yoga</h3>\n<p>Like competing convertible hybrid laptops, the Inspiron 11 3000 can fold its screen back 360 degrees to make for multiple use modes. (Stop me if you''ve heard this one before.) During a preview event in New York, I flipped the device into all the usual modes.</p>\n<p>The sturdy dual hinge kept the same tension as I switched between laptop, tent (standing on its edges), display (standing on its keyboard face) and tablet modes. The use cases for these modes haven''t changed all that much with Dell''s take on the design.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dellinspiron113000-1-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Inspiron 11 3000 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Both tent and display (also known as "stand" or "presentation" mode) modes are ideal for viewing content, while the other two modes are rather self-explanatory. You''ve likely already made up your mind on which side of the fence you stand regarding these kind of devices. What matters is how the design makes them feel.</p>\n<p>All of the laptop''s ends are round and symmetrical, while its sides are flat. The only visible difference between the lid and base are their dimensions, with the base being thicker, naturally. The entire laptop is comprised of a plastic material in a silver hue, which gives it a slightly more premium feel than its asking price suggests.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dellinspiron113000-4-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Inspiron 11 3000 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>However, the presence of the spill-resistant, membrane keyboard made the transition between modes awkward, as it didn''t deactivate quickly enough and registered unintentional keystrokes. And without any rubber feet to keep steady in tent mode, the Inspiron slipped under my presses.</p>\n<p>The entire device measures 7.9 x 11.6 x 0.76 inches (W x D x H) and weighs 3.07 pounds. Now of course, for a $449 (about £268, AU$483) price tag to start, don''t expect to find mind-blowing hardware inside, but there''s enough here to get things done.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dellinspiron113000-6-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Inspiron 11 3000 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>It''s what''s on the inside that counts</h3>\n<p>Powering the visuals behind that just-about-HD screen are either a dual-core or quad-core Intel Celeron processor (Haswell) with Intel HD Graphics. Supporting that chip are 4GB of DDR3 RAM, and there''s a 500GB hard drive for storage.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, Dell managed to include 802.11ac Wi-Fi - a telling sign of the new wireless standard going mainstream - and Bluetooth 4.0. As for hard connections, the Inspiron 11 sports three USB ports (one 3.0), an HDMI port, an SD card slot and a headphone/mic jack.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dellinspiron113000-8-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Inspiron 11 3000 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Also on the outside is a 720p webcam with microphone for Skype and other video chat apps. Keeping all of those components running is a 3-cell, 43 Whr battery that Dell claims can last up to 8 hours (and 18 minutes, to be exact). Not too shabby for a laptop under 500 bucks.</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>While aimed at students, I have a hard time seeing exactly who the Dell Inspiron 11 3000 will serve best. Frankly, I find it difficult to work on screens smaller than 13 inches, especially at a 16:9 aspect ratio, and I generally don''t find an improvised tablet all that useful or convenient.</p>\n<p>Although this is aimed for the budget-buying crowd, even Dell puts out more affordable options, like the . Sure, that device doesn''t offer multiple modes, a touch-friendly  and gobs of storage. Regardless, it''s where I would point the cash-strapped undergrad that''s probably already knee-deep in Google services.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Dell has a near-identical 13-inch variant in the works for a September launch. But who knows, the Inspiron 11 3000 might grow on me when we get one in for a full review.

There are some negatives that hold it back from being truly great, however.', '&#160;', '<div>The Dell Precision M4800 is a powerhouse. Claimed by Dell to be the world''s most powerful 15-inch mobile workstation, it packs enough hardware to allow for desktop-like performance.</div>\n<p>Although Dell has recently launched a mobile workstation that comes in a thin chassis, the , the Dell Precision M4800 is more in keeping with the traditional appearance of the Precision line. It doesn''t try to be thin or light but instead has a solid, tank-like chassis that''s 40 mm thick and weighs 2.9 KG. You could squeeze two or three entire Ultrabooks into the same space.</p>\n<p>The Dell Precision M4800 is coated in Dell''s signature gunmetal dark grey case. It''s a look that screams professional use more than fun and games - whip out the thick-and-heavy M4800 on a train, complete with its array of flashing status lights and expansion ports, instead of a small device like a tablet, and your fellow commuters will undoubtedly imagine you''re very serious about computing.</p>\n<p>No corners have been cut to reduce the Dell Precision M4800''s physical size. A total of 11 status LEDs flicker on and off. There''s a built-in optical drive, smart card reader, SD card reader, four USB 3 ports, with a further E-Sata/USB 2 port at the rear. There''s also DisplayPort and HDMI rounded off by Gigabit ethernet as well. Dell has sensibly retained the analogue D-Sub connector, since the majority of displays and projectors in office environments still use this video standard.</p>\n<p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dell-precision-m4800-1-600-100.jpg" alt="Dell Precision M4800" /></p>\n<p>Dell avoids the isolated-style keyboard, using a more traditional keyboard style. It squeezes a full-size number pad onto the side as well, and has a ''nipple'' to control the mouse right in the centre, between the G and H keys.</p>\n<p>The physical volume controls in the top left are joined by WiFi, Bluetooth, disk access, and power indicators. The trackpad is disappointingly small but there are physical buttons for left and right clicking.</p>\n<p>Dell''s site offers four specific M4800 models, which start at £1179 ex VAT. The entry-level version has a 2.7 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 4800MQ processor, 8GB of memory, a 1080p full HD display, 500GB hard disk and an Nvidia Quadro K1100M GPU.</p>\n<p>You also can create your own Dell Precision M4800 specification, and choose from a long list of configuration options. It''s one of the few laptops that allows you to have 32GB of memory, which seems an excessive amount for office applications and web browsing, but it''s great for engineers who work with multiple-gigabyte projects or photographers who edit photos in RAW format.</p>\n<p>You can choose a larger hybrid hard disk, or an SSD from 128 GB to 512 GB, an AMD FirePro M5100 or an Nvidia Quadro K2100M GPU. If you want the highest possible performance, you can add a 3 GHz Intel Core i7 4930MX processor, which has a Turbo Frequency of 3.9 GHz, unbelievably fast for a 15-inch laptop.</p>\n<p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dell-precision-m4800-3-600-100.jpg" alt="Dell Precision M4800" /></p>\n<p>The version tested here has 16GB of memory, a 2.8 GHz Core i7 4900MQ processor, 1TB hybrid hard disk and an Nvidia Quadro K2100M graphics card with 2GB of GDDR5 memory.</p>\n<p>The Nvidia Quadro K2100M is of particular interest, as it has the same 576 shaders and clock speeds as the beefier previous-generation K3000M GPU. The K3000M has more memory and higher memory bandwidth, but a much higher TDP, which restricts its use to 17-inch laptops.</p>\n<p>The M4800 can be ordered with a QHD+ (3200 x 1800) display, but the Dell Precision M4800 tested here is the 1920 x 1080 version, which has a twisted-nematic (TN) display. This has some benefits, such as less drain on the battery, but also some downsides, as we found in our testing. The QHD+ screen is still an option though, if you customise the configuration.</p>\n<p>The screen has a matte finish, which looks infinitely better than a glossy screen, and is not touch-sensitive. You get Windows 7 as standard, rather than Windows 8 or 8.1. Either version of the newer operating system is optional, but Microsoft''s latest has gone down with workstation users as well as praise for David Moyes at a Manchester United match.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p>The gap between top-of-the-line mobile CPUs and desktop chips is narrowing with each generation. The high-end quad-core chips available in the Dell M4800 are remarkably powerful, and performed superbly in benchmark tests.</p>\n<p>The Cinebench 15 CPU score of 609 is just 6 points shy of the score achieved by an older desktop 3.5 GHz Intel Core i7 3770K Ivy Bridge CPU. A render test in 3D Studio Max was 30 seconds faster with the Dell Precision M4800 than the same desktop Intel Core i7 3770K processor. That''s great news for 3D designers, since the high-end specification of the Dell Precision M4800 is perfect for use with software such as Solidworks, Maya and Nuke.</p>\n<p>While there''s still quite a distance between desktop and mobile graphics card performance, the Quadro K2100M is certainly a powerful GPU. It delivered a score of 69.3 in Cinebench 15, which is about a third less than you get from an entry-level desktop workstation card.</p>\n<p>Its SPECViewPerf scores were lower by a similar margin, but still point to 3D software running more than adequately. When the Dell Precision M4800 is kitted out with the full complement of 32GB of memory, expect to be able to work with highly detailed models in CAD software.</p>\n<p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/7-600-100.jpg" alt="Dell Precision M4800" /></p>\n<p>In 3DMark, the scores are more than reasonable, with 1670 points in the taxing ''Fire Strike'' test a sign that you should be able to run most modern games, although don''t expect to be able to enjoy a constantly high frame rate with anti-aliasing set to maximum.</p>\n<p>The hybrid hard disk is so named due to its inclusion of 8GB of flash memory to act as a cache for the data on the hard disk. It''s not as good as having a true SSD, but does work out less expensive for higher capacities. Nevertheless, its presence was felt in slower boot times and application load times than systems equipped with an SSD.</p>\n<p>The Dell Precision M4800 measured fairly middling burst read speeds of 47 MB/s when tested with CrystalDiskMark, but faster write speeds of 106 MB/s.</p>\n<p>Arguably, SSDs are now essential rather than a luxury, given the overall performance difference they make. The Dell Precision M4800 can be customised with an SSD boot drive and a hard disk in the secondary bay, which would undoubtedly be our preferred configuration, although this adds to the cost - £264 for the SSD and up to £98 for the 1TB hard disk.</p>\n<p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dell-precision-m4800-2-600-100.jpg" alt="Dell Precision M4800" /></p>\n<p>The biggest disappointment is the display. TN panels simply aren''t very good, and may make you wince the moment the Dell Precision M4800 is switched on. With an IPS or IGZO display, you can expect viewing angles approaching 180 degrees, so when viewed from the side, the display looks identical to when it''s viewed head-on. But TN panels looks darker from the side, and aren''t as clear.</p>\n<p>We used a Spyder4 colorimeter to measure the tonal response of both the original Dell Precision M4800 with an IGZO QHD+ display and the 1080p version. The IGZO screen provided 98% SRGB coverage, but the TN panel could only muster 80%, which is nothing special by modern standards.</p>\n<p>Graphics professionals are likely to be one of the main groups interested in the high performance of the top-end Dell Precision M4800 models, so less-than-accurate colour response is disappointing.</p>\n<p>However having a matte finish makes up for it somewhat, since it''s much easier to see what you''re doing in a brightly lit room. Being 1920 x 1080 it also neatly avoids any issues with DPI scaling that is a current problem with high-PPI displays in certain software packages, including Adobe Creative Suite. A 15.6-inch display at this resolution looks absolutely perfect.</p>\n<p>In battery life tests, the TN 1080p screen in the Dell Precision M4800 does seems to drain power less than the 3200 x 1800 QHD+ display. However, the improvement isn''t huge. PC Mark 08 lasted for 2hrs 59 minutes, which is about 50% less than an Ultrabook manages.</p>', '', 'delllaptophero-160-80.jpg', '7-600-100.jpg', NULL, 'The Dell Precision M4800 is a powerhouse.

But sometimes, there''s still no substitute for simple screen size. That''s especially true for gaming. Enter the Medion Erazer X7611 laptop.</p><p>It''s a full-on desktop replacement gaming portable with a monumental 17.3-inch, full 1080p display. It packs a full-on Intel quad-core processor and Nvidia graphics with 2GB of video memory.</p><p>For storage, you get both solid state and magnetic hard drives. Oh and there''s the minor matter of a mere 16GB of system memory.</p><p>It also sports a plethora of ports and card readers, a webcam and integrated sound complete with a subwoofer. By now you should be getting an idea of a system that doesn''t just tick the desktop-replacement box. It really delivers on the notion.</p><p>And yet despite all that, it''s just 2.3cm thick. OK, the 17-inch screen makes for a chassis that''s over 40cm wide.</p><p>But your typical 17-inch gaming brick is usually so much thicker. . it''s over twice as thick and not far off twice as heavy.  is significantly thicker and heavier, too.</p><p>Of course, both of those systems are both pricier and sport higher spec graphics chips. But choice is a very fine thing and depending on exactly what you''re after from a gaming portable, and especially if you want something either mnore affordable or a bit easier to lug about, this Medion might just have the makings of a winner.</p><h3>Specifications</h3><p>First up, processing power. Intel now offers a baffling array of processor models so you may not have heard of the Core-i7 4700HQ. </p><p>But no bother, it''s barely any different to any other current quad-core. All that varies of note is clockspeeds and cache. This particular item rocks in at 2.4GHz nominal, 3.4GHz Turbo and sports 6MB of on-die cache memory.</p><p>That puts it towards the low end of Intel''s quad-core mobile line up. But make no mistake. It''s an extremely powerful quad-core chip by any sensible metric. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/medion20erazer20x7611205-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Medion Erazer"><figcaption>The Erazer''s chassis is a quality item</figcaption></figure></p><p>Slightly more open to debate is the fitness of the Nvidia GeForce GTX 765M graphics. While a low -end Intel quad-core chip is very nearly the same as a hgih-end quad-core model, that''s not so for graphics chips.</p><p>The GTX 765M is a proper discrete 3D chip designed for gaming. But it''s pretty modestly specified. It sports 768 CUDA cores running at 797MHz and a 128-bit bus. </p><p>Nvidia''s fastest desktop graphics offer nearly four times the CUDA cores and triple the bus width. Not a fair comparison?</p><p>Perhaps, but it does put this ''gaming'' graphics chip into context. Whatever, it''s less than half as powerful as the fastest mobile graphics chip Nvidia currently does. Hmmm.</p><p>Next up, storage. Our test sample came with a 128GB SanDisk SSD, but Medion''s official spec includes a 64GB drive at this price.</p><p>Along side the SSD is a 1TB conventional magnetic drive for mass storage. There''s also a very healthy 16GB of RAM in dual-channel configuration.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/medion20erazer20x7611204-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Medion Erazer"><figcaption>Not as skinny as an iPhone, but still just 23mm thick</figcaption></figure></p><p>Ports-wise, we''re talking four USB 4.0 sockets, a multi-card reader, LAN, HDMI and no fewer than two mini DisplayPort outputs. For wireless networking, there''s an Intel n-spec adapter.</p><p>For sound you get a stereo-speaker-plus-subwoofer solution with Dolby certification, for what that is worth, but Medion doesn''t quote a battery capacity. The screen, finally, is a 17.3-inch LED backlit item with 1,920 by 1,080 pixels. Medion doesn''t quote the panel type, but we reckon it''s TN.</p><p>Oh and for the record, there is no optical drive. Surprising for a 17-inch rig? Perhaps, but then the days of optical are very nearly dead.</p><p>As for dimensions, the key numbers are 418mm, 288mm, 23mm and 2.68kg.</p><h3>Performance</h3><p>On the CPU side, the Intel Core-i7 4700HQ puts in a pretty predictable performance. And that means it''s just excellent. You simply will not want for raw CPU power with this laptop.</p><p>As for storage, it''s a bit more complicated. The 128GB SanDisk drive in our review unit puts in some pretty decent numbers with around 450MB/s sequential reads and 250MB/s writes. The random access performance is good, too.</p><p>However, it''s likely any 64BG SSD will have more modest performance due to the limitations of smaller SSDs involving memory channels and NAND memory chip counts. It''s unlikely to be a deal breaker, but it worth bearing in mind.</p><p>The built-in audio system is another strong point. The sound quality isn''t exactly audiophile. But the volume levels are darn impressive for a laptop. And that means you could take the Erazer on hols without the need to bring a spare set of speakers. Handy.</p><p>The 17.3-inch LCD screen is mostly a good thing, too. It doesn''t offer the expansive viewing angles of an IPS panel. But nor is it one of those really poor TN items.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/medion20erazer20x7611203-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Medion Erazer"><figcaption>Strong quad-core CPU performance, but the Nvidia graphics is only just OK</figcaption></figure></p><p>Colours are rich, contrast is decent. The response rates are pretty nippy for a mobile panel, which is welcome for a portable with a gaming remit.</p><p>Speaking of gaming, what about that critical graphics performance? We can''t give you a 3DMark result, sadly, as a software glitch meant it simply refused to run. But we''ve ran several other benchmarks.</p><p>For an idea of how well an older arcade-style game runs, Grid 2 flys along at 70 frames per second. That''s at 1080p and the settings cranked up to high. Nice.</p><p>Less impressive is Call of Juarez: Gunslinger. Here you''re looking at just 22 frames per second, again at 1080p and high quality settings. The geometry-heavy Heaven benchmark, meanwhile, is down at just 14 frames per second at similar settings.</p><p>Of course, you can improve those numbers by cutting back on the eye candy. But the overall jist is of a gaming system that will require you to make compromises and fine tune the settings. It''s certainly not powerful enough that you simply set everything to full reheat and fire up any game.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/medion20erazer20x7611206-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Medion Erazer"><figcaption>The Erazer X7611 makes more sense as an all-rounder than a pure gaming portable</figcaption></figure></p><p>Battery life is another result that''s best described as middling. Three and a half hours of 720p video playback isn''t bad for a 17 incher. But with smaller notebooks now offering something approaching all-day longevity, it''s not that wonderful, either.</p><p>More of an unambiguous win is the overall build and robustness of the chassis. It''s extremely solid and flex free &ndash; and that includes the backlit keyboard. Generally, it feels a high quality item and impressively so given the aggressive pricing.</p><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Big portables have generally gone out of fashion. Bit with one exception: gaming laptops. The downside, apart from girth and weight, us usally price. On paper, the Medion Erazer seems to attack all those issues. It''s both relatively thin and light and relatively affordable for this sort of system.</p><h3>We liked</h3><p>First and foremost, it''s a good looking and good felling laptop. Medion is broadly a budget brand, but you won''t feel like you''ve cut corners. It''s a sleek looking, solid feeling portable.</p><p>The spec is good, too, on the whole. The quad-core Intel CPU is all you''ll ever need. There''s a mix of fast SSD and magnetic mass storage along with oodles of RAM.</p><p>The 17.3-inch 1080p LCD is generally a nice panel and well suited to gaming and there are plenty of ports on offer.</p><h3>We disliked</h3><p>It''s a fine line, but the Nvidia GeForce GTX 765M probably doesn''t offer quite the level of gaming grunt we''re after from a specialist portable.</p><p>Make no mistake, this is a genuinely gameable system. But it has little performance to spare and over time we suspect it will just feel slower and slower. The three and a half hours of battery life will also be a deal breaker for some.</p><h3>Final verdict</h3><p>As a pure gaming rig, the Medion Erazer X7611 is a bit mediocre thanks to its middling Nvidia graphics.</p><p>However, view it as a broader multimedia desktop replacement system and it''s much more compelling. It''s a quality item with a nice screen and excellent all-round performance.

Just 0.3mm of extra keyboard travel of overall last year''s model may not sound like much, but let me assure you that means an excellent typing experience.</p>\n<p>Look out, Apple: For typing and easy transportation, the Acer Aspire S7 is getting dangerously close to your . And it''s even punchier than what''s on offer from the . Now, if only it could squeeze as much battery life out of its Haswell processor, and I wouldn''t mind if it centered up that touchpad, either.</p>\n<p>&lt;object width="580" height="356"&gt;\n<param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iZlXKU3Yhek&hl=en&fs=1" />\n<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />\n<param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /> &lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iZlXKU3Yhek&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="580" height="356"&gt;&lt;/embed> &lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>The changes to the Aspire S7 are hardly skin deep, and for good reason. It had a gorgeous design to begin with, and Acer has stuck with it. This is the same aluminum frame wrapping a pearly white plastic and Gorilla Glass encasement. There''s the same aluminum keyboard deck with silver plastic keys, and the laptop''s underside is coated in soft touch plastic, just like it was last year.</p>\n<p>Subtle adjustments have been made, like the larger power button near the hinge. It''s more prominently placed near the power port – rather than next to the audio jack on the side of last year''s S7 – making it much easier to find. The S7 still maintains a clean, MacBook-like look, with a lot of space between the function keys and hinges.</p>\n<p>Before we start getting into internals, I should mention that Acer has revisited its cooling solution for the Aspire S7. It''s kept the dual fans just above the keyboard, but reduced the amount of fan blades and is now running them at 10,000 rpm. Fan noise was a common complaint with last year''s model, that it sounded like a jumbo jet when streaming Netflix or a little Photoshop.</p>\n<p>These fans suck less power, and while you may not see it on your electric bill, they do make for an incredibly cool and quiet computing experience, which is rare get from an Ultrabook.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/aceraspires7-13-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Acer Aspire S7 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Welcome to Tweak Town</h3>\n<p>The overarching theme with the new Aspire S7 is tweaks, changes that don''t mess with what has already earned Acer acclaim from critics. Moving power buttons, adjusting fan speeds and increasing key travel aren''t back of the box, bullet point-type changes, but together, they make a for an improved computing experience.</p>\n<p>There wasn''t much more that Acer needed to do to keep pace with the competition (or even earn our "Recommended" Award). But the vendor managed to make an already-premium system look and feel even more so than before. Just as importantly, Acer didn''t cut anything critics loved last time, either.</p>\n<p>You''ve gotta love the sci-fi electroluminescent backlighting on the Aspire keyboard. Not only does it set the S7 aesthetic apart, it''s easier on the eyes in low light than many  notebook keyboards.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/aceraspires7-16-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Acer Aspire S7 review" /><figcaption>It lights up like something out of Star Trek</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The edge-to-edge glass screen – which can bend back 180 degrees and lay flat – on the Aspire S7 is also a fantastic touch. This makes gestures feel seamless as you draw your index finger in from the right edge of the panel to summon the Charms menu.</p>\n<p>Of course, there''s plenty more that Acer tweaked, like introducing the Aspire S7 to Intel''s latest mobile chips, the fourth generation Core i series.

Lenovo is next to jump in on the leisure Google laptop trend, but with a twist.</p>\n<p>This is the Lenovo N20p Chromebook, a multi-mode Chrome laptop with a 10-point, multi-touch display – the first of its kind, I reckon. Lenovo fans will immediately notice that this Chromebook is essentially a shrunken  with a new OS on top.</p>\n<p>And Lenovo used that strategy to great effect, crafting one of the sharpest Chromebooks seen yet. However, talk about combining two of the most divisive technologies into a single machine, neither of which seem like much of a fit for Chrome OS. And to think that Lenovo brought even more primo hardware to Google''s laptop spec.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovon20pchromebook-6-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo N20p Chromebook review" /><figcaption>You might dig the stark angles and corners as much as I do</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Only the coolest for Chrome</h3>\n<p>Many of the components rattled off for the N20p could be copied and pasted from an earlier Chromebook review. You have the 11.6-inch 1366 x 768 touchscreen, a quad-core Intel Celeron processor, 16GB of eMMC storage, up to 4GB of DDR3 RAM and a 1MP webcam. This is all standard fare for the Chrome OS notebook spec.</p>\n<p>But Lenovo spared no expense as far as connectivity is concerned. Not only did the company provide the N20p with Bluetooth 4.0, but with 802.11ac Wi-Fi to match. That could be a bigger deal than it sounds.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovon20pchromebook-2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo N20p Chromebook review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Where Acer looks to boost video conferencing and other more intense tasks through the first Core i series-equipped Chromebook, Lenovo hopes to do much of the same through the latest Wi-Fi standard. Honestly, both would be nice, but since Chrome OS relies so deeply on an internet connection, AC networking could give the N20p the edge it needs.</p>\n<h3>Touchy, yet flexible</h3>\n<p>And if that doesn''t do the trick, it looks like Lenovo in banking on the N20p''s touch control and stand mode grabbing your attention. Granted, it''s interesting to see folks trying new things with Chrome OS already – this is as good a time for experimentation as any.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovon20pchromebook-hero-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo N20p Chromebook review" /><figcaption>Tent mode is more of an improvised mode, really</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>But the prospect of touch control on Chrome OS is already dubious. Being a largely browser-based operating system, Chrome isn''t exactly tailored to touch. And while the Flex-inspired stand mode will make for some nice bedside Netflix viewing, I really doubt that it will make for much use beyond that.</p>\n<p>And the same goes for the improvised tent mode. If there isn''t much utility for these use modes on Windows 8, which was developed with touch control and unique form factors in mind, then what good will they do for Chromebooks? Perhaps it''s a good thing that the N20p has a touch-less cousin, known simply as the N20.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovon20pchromebook-8-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo N20p Chromebook review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>While I wasn''t able to turn the device on at a preview event I attended, the N20p keyboard appeared snappy enough with little flex. The clickpad audibly clicked with a decent amount of force, a key sign of quality in my book.</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>Don''t get me wrong, the Lenovo N20p Chromebook is one of the most gorgeous Google-stamped laptops I''ve seen yet.

The new MacBook Airs also use faster flash storage. It''s up to 45% quicker than the previous generation, and nine times faster than a standard hard drive. </p><p>Wi-Fi is faster too, with the new MacBook Airs giving us  wireless internet. This is up to three times as fast as wireless n and offers a better range, assuming your router also offers the ac protocol. Beam forming technology focuses the signal onto connected ac devices for a much more stable connection, too.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/macbook20air201320inch2012-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="13-inch MacBook Air 2013 review"></figure></p><p>Of course, where the new Haswell processors really show their worth is in battery life. According to Apple, the new 13-inch MacBook Air lasts up to 12 hours on a single charge, or 10 hours of movie playback over iTunes. </p><p>Like all recent MacBook Airs, when you close the lid it enters Standby Mode, an ultra-low energy state that can last for up to 30 days on a full battery. When you open the lid again, it''s on straight away, though its fast solid state storage means it boots extremely fast even when switched off.</p><p>The new 13-inch MacBook Air has a second microphone to reduce background noise when using features such as FaceTime or Dictation.

Packing in such a high resolution it''s impossible to distinguish between individual pixels at a normal viewing distance, Retina screens proved extremely popular on recent MacBook Pro and  models. Yet we didn''t get one on the 2013 MacBook Airs, even as a custom option for those ordering on the Apple online store. Perhaps it would''ve taken too great a toll on the battery life.</p><h3>Performance</h3><p>The new Haswell processors use very little power, giving the 2013 13-inch MacBook Air and absolutely stunning battery life. In our test, in which we streamed the live BBC News channel feed on iPlayer over a wireless network, the laptop lasted for nine hours. That''s significantly better than the 11-inch MacBook Air''s 7 hours 15 minutes, and a substantial improvement over the 2012 MacBook Air''s 5.5 hours. </p><p>Since switching to solid state storage off the shelf with the late 2010 update, the MacBook Air has been known for its good battery life. But with the Haswell processors in place, it''s absolutely stunning. At last, you can use your notebook all day long on a single charge.</p><p><strong>Benchmarks</strong><br> Xbench: 357.50<br> Cinebench 10 Single core: 4242<br> Cinebench 10 Multi-core: 8636<br> iTunes encoding (USB SuperDrive): 452 seconds<br> Movie encoding (iMovie): 242.6 seconds<br><em>Doom 3</em>: 68.9fps<br><em>Call of Duty 4</em>: 67.8fps<br> Battery: 9 hours<br> Novabench, Total: 589<br> Novabench, Graphics: 44</p><p>Although the processors have a slower clock speed than the previous generation, across-the-board performance improvements mostly make up the difference. </p><p>The faster graphics enjoyed by the Haswell processors meant that in our <em>Call of Duty 4</em> test, the 2013 13-inch MacBook Air ran the game at 67.8 frames per second, compared to 59.5fps for the 13-inch, 1.8GHz dual core Intel Core i5 model from 2012. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/macbook20air201320inch201-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="13-inch MacBook Air 2013 review"></figure></p><p>The much older <em>Doom 3</em>, however, seemed less able to take advantage of the Intel HD 5000 Graphics, running at 68.9fps on the 2013 Air, and 83.0fps on last year''s model. </p><p>The new MacBook Air''s faster storage gave it a definite advantage in our Xbench test, which we set up to measure both the CPU and storage performance. Its score of 357.50 was 5.4% up on last year''s model. </p><p>But the swings-and-roundabouts improvement offered by the new MacBook Air is clearly demonstrated by our Cinebench test, where graphical and processing power is assessed first using a single core and then with every core available (on these dual-core, Hyper-Threading chips, that''s four cores). Using only one core, the 2013 MacBook Air''s score of 4242 is 3.9% up on last year''s model, but with all cores in play, the 2012 MacBook Air''s faster clock speed takes its toll - the 2013 model is actually 1.8% down. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/macbook20air201320inch203-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="13-inch MacBook Air 2013 review"></figure></p><p>It''s around 40 seconds slower when encoding our five-minute test movie to iPod format using iMovie, too.</p><p>One thing that hasn''t changed is the laptop''s display. It''s still a 1440 x 900 resolution, 13.3-inch LED-backlit glossy widescreen display, with rich, deep colours and good viewing angles. </p><p>The new MacBook Airs are just as portable as their predecessors too, with a tapered height of 0.3-1.7cm (0.11-0.68 inches), a width of 32.5cm 912.8 inches) and a depth of 22.7cm (8.94 inches). Most impressively of all, it weighs just 1.35kg (2.96lbs). If you''re sick of lugging a hefty notebook around with you, the MacBook Air could be just what you need.</p><h3>Verdict</h3><p>The new 2013 13-inch MacBook Air makes some significant improvements on the 2012 model, but the processor''s clock speeds are down. In performance terms, this means it outperforms its predecessor in some tests, but falls behind in others, generally by small margins. </p><p>However, there''s one test where the new MacBook Air clearly trounces the previous model...</p><h3>We liked</h3><p>...And that''s battery life. The Haswell processors are designed to go light on power, and it shows. On a full charge, the new 13-inch MacBook Air is good for 12 hours of general computing, and lasted for nine hours of live video streaming. Very impressive figures. The new storage, which is 45% faster than the previous generation, and graphics that are around 40% quicker than before, are also to be commended, as are the switch to Wi-Fi ac and the inclusion of a second mic for reducing ambient noise.</p><p>Key features we loved about previous MacBook Airs haven''t gone away either. It''s still incredibly light and portable, is very strong despite being thin and has a beautiful backlit keyboard. The multi-touch trackpad is a great asset too.</p><h3>We disliked</h3><p>But why did Apple have to reduce the processor''s clock speed? It''s down to 1.3GHz, from 2012''s 1.8GHz, both dual-core Intel Core i5 chips. Improvements elsewhere - most notably the graphics and storage - mean you don''t notice it all that much, but we wish the new MacBook Air CPUs at least matched the old ones.</p><p>The expected Retina screen failed to emerge too, even as a custom option on the Apple online store, but we''ve mixed feelings about this one anyway. Although gorgeous to look at, would it have compromised the battery life to too great a degree? Talking of the Apple online store, if you want to upgrade your MacBook Air it''s best to do it here at the time of purchase, since you can''t make component upgrades later.</p><h3>Final verdict</h3><p>Despite the swings-and-roundabouts benchmarking results, the new MacBook Air is a definite and significant step up from last year''s release. The battery life is little short of incredible. Business travellers taking long flights and students who need it all day for lectures and then throughout the evening for writing an essay will love its all-day power. </p><p>The new MacBook Airs take it into the Wi-Fi ac era too, giving speedier, more stable wireless connections - as long as your router is also wireless ac.</p><p>The faster graphics and quicker storage do much to compensate for the slower processors, but we wish Apple had at least matched the 2012 MacBook Air''s clock speeds.</p> ', '', 'macbook20air2011inch-160-80.jpg', 'macbook20air201320inch2013-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'Apple''s often imitated but never bettered ultra-portable laptop puts in a strong, though not', 'Apple''s often imitated but never bettered ultra-portable laptop puts in a strong, though not faultless, performance with this mid-2013 release, the sixth-generation of the MacBook Air.

(More on those later.) Plenty has changed in laptop design since 2012, the year of the most recent X1 before this refresh, and Lenovo has clearly kept up.</p>\n<p>In addition to shaving off a tenth of a pound and nearly the same figure in inches, the company introduced a nifty new adaptive row of keys in lieu of your standard function keys. Lenovo also slapped two USB 3.0 ports on this year''s X1, stretched the clickpad by over three tenths of an inch and introduced a new mini RJ-45 Ethernet port.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovothinkpadx1carbon-11-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>But since 2012, Lenovo''s competitors haven''t sat idle either.

The new X1 is no slouch in either regard, I found after putting it through the ringer for some time.</p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>Upon opening the box, the iconic ThinkPad and Lenovo logos appear embossed onto the device''s soft touch, carbon fiber lid. That material coats the entire frame from keyboard deck to base, though the laptop''s underside is comprised of an equally smooth magnesium aluminum alloy.</p>\n<p>The carbon fiber makes for fantastic palm rests, but is highly susceptible to fingerprints and smudges. Opening the lid reveals two wobbly hinges, although they only shake within a strict range of motion – it''s impossible to push the lid open further with one hand.

All in all, the X1 Carbon might topple the ThinkPad Yoga as the best-designed ThinkPad yet.</p>\n<h3>Electro-illuminating the way</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most noticeable and important change to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon is what Lenovo calls the Adaptive Function Row. Designed to add more utility than what the standard row of function keys can provide in such a limited space, this row of keys uses two key technologies: liquid crystal and electroluminescence.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovothinkpadx1carbon-15-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The first is a patented technology that easily reflects light, meaning that whatever is underneath becomes more legible. In this case, that''s a series of laser-etched icons on a screen-printed backlight layer. Finally, an emissive electroluminescent layer allows the backlight to shine through the icons for different colors and visibility in direct light.</p>\n<p>These all work in tandem underneath Corning Gorilla Glass to serve up a range of unique utilities that physical function keys could never cover. Switch to Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome or Safari, and the row automatically changes to display functions like refresh, page navigation and opening new windows. Switch to Skype, and a host of video chat-centric functions appear instantly.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovothinkpadx1carbon-1-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Shiny new features are nice and all, but business users care more for what''s on the inside.

At least that''s what gaming hardware vendor MSI claims, pegging its brand new GS60 Ghost Pro at around four pounds. I had the chance to play around with a prototype unit of the company''s latest thin and light gaming laptop - the same one that I saw, but couldn''t touch, at this year''s .</p>\n<p>"But, MSI already released its GS60 Ghost," you say? You''re right, the company just launched its first 15.6-inch thin and light gaming laptop, the GS60 Ghost, packed with an FHD display and Nvidia''s latest 800M series GPUs. But remember: MSI hinted during CES that this machine could go as sharp as a 3K resolution at launch.</p>\n<p>Today, the GS60 Ghost earns the "Pro" moniker, thanks to a 2880 x 1620 WQHD panel. Behind that super sharp screen on the model that I tested out is an Nvidia GeForce GTX 870M with 6GB of GDDR5 RAM. Backing up that beefy video card are Intel''s quad-core, 2.4GHz Core i7-4700HQ and 16GB of DDR3 RAM at 1600MHz.</p>\n<p>Between those guts and a 128GB SSD-1TB HDD storage combo, I''m not at all surprised that MSI projects that this beast will cost around $2,000 (about £1,194, AU$2,128) upon release later this April or in early May. And the company may even boost the available storage and RAM capacity. That might be overkill.</p>\n<h3>Super sharp shooting</h3>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/msigs60ghostpro-3-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="MSI GS60 Ghost Pro" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>To show off just how well Nvidia''s GPUs can handle beyond-HD resolutions, MSI had the GS60 Ghost Pro running Metro: Last Light. Even almost a year after its release, Last Light is still one of the most demanding PC games around, a fine benchmark for 3K gaming.</p>\n<p>While I didn''t have time to get into a firefight in the tunnels beneath a nuclear Russia, I witnessed zero frame rate dips while walking around a militia headquarters. That was with the game running at the laptop''s native pixel count, the detail settings set to normal and anti-aliasing set to 4X with vertical sync disabled. That said, screen tearing was evident throughout. Perhaps if you were to bring anti-aliasing down a notch, you''d be able to activate v-sync without issue.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/msigs60ghostpro-7-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="MSI GS60 Ghost Pro" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Regardless, it''s official: At least for Nvidia, mobile hardware has officially caught up to the next leap in PC gaming. Considering how demanding of a game Last Light is, I imagine that less graphically intense games will run at higher settings behind 3K.</p>\n<h3>Got a light?</h3>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/msigs60ghostpro-5-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="MSI GS60 Ghost Pro" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>If you don''t, then MSI has you covered … and then some. The company''s collaboration with SteelSeries lives on in the Ghost Pro. That means you''ll get a SteelSeries-made keyboard with some crazy backlighting and configuration options.</p>\n<p>Using the included SteelSeries Engine software, you can light this laptop''s keyboard up like a vivid rainbow or even localize lighting to specific keys, like the WASD area. Plus, you can program macros and lighting configurations for each game with application profiles.</p>\n<p>MSI couldn''t help itself with the lighting, as the front of its brushed magnesium frame features blue indicator LEDs for several statuses. Even the power button light changes from blue to orange when the 870M kicks in through Nvidia''s Optimus graphics switching tech. (It''s pretty useful, honestly.)</p>\n<h3>Early verdict</h3>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/msigs60ghostpro-8-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="MSI GS60 Ghost Pro" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>At just about four pounds and with the power and features it offers, the MSI GS60 Ghost Pro stands to give rivals like the  a worthy challenge.

The best part? It''s only &pound;400 (about US$664, AU$717).</p><p>That money usually means cheap and nasty, but that''s not the case here. The TouchSmart''s lid is silver-coloured and is covered with little white dots that aren''t too intrusive but make this machine stand out against identikit rivals, and it''s topped off by a smart HP logo in the centre.</p><p>The good looks continue when the lid is eased open. The interior is black and glossy, with subtle silver dots lined all over the wrist-rest, and it''s paired by simple glossy bezel around the 15.6in screen. The base is ringed by a metal-effect border that tapers to a narrow front edge, it''s a neat visual trick &ndash; it makes the HP look slimmer as it hides the black plastic beneath, and it''s reminiscent of many more expensive Ultrabooks and Apple notebooks.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/img1376-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="HP Pavilion side"><figcaption>The HP Pavilion TouchSmart 15-n070sa is well designed and reminiscent of the ultrabook style </figcaption></figure></p><p>The good looks are balanced with reasonable build quality.

The screen is the only area where there''s any real weakness; its sides are sturdy thanks to a pair of hefty hinges, but the middle of the panel is noticeably weaker. This machine is 23mm thick and weighs 2.3kg &ndash; heavier than Ultrabooks, sure, but perfectly manageable. </p><p>The trackpad is sunken into the wrist-rest, and it''s coated with a rough, dimpled pattern. It''s a strange feeling since many rivals have smooth pads but it works well, indicating where the pad begins and adding some welcome grip to the surface. The two buttons aren''t as good: they''re hinged at the bottom, and so they''re easier to press at the top, but tricky further down.

There''s just no consistency or comfort, and we wouldn''t want to use the HP for prolonged work.</p><p>The Touchsmart is all about clean corners and gentle lines, with no sharp angles, and it clasps together to make a great-looking laptop. It''s certainly better than a bevy of recent rivals: the  was dark and bland,  series is similarly uninspiring, and HP''s own  ruined its decent looks with terrible build quality &ndash; not something we can say about this particular Pavilion, which isn''t perfect but still manages to feel much stronger.</p><p>In fact, the only affordable laptop we''ve seen recently to rival this machine for looks was , which mimicked Ultrabooks with a slim, metal-effect design &ndash; but it''s also around &pound;100 more expensive than this HP.</p><p>The &pound;400 budget bites elsewhere, though, and it means that this system hasn''t got the best specification. The interior revolves around AMD''s A4-5000, which is a mobile part from the firm''s Kabini mobile range. It''s one of the more powerful chips from this series, but its specification doesn''t suggest it''ll be a speed demon: four cores that run at 1.5GHz with no extra boost, just 2MB of cache, and a Radeon HD 8330 graphics core clocked to a middling 497MHz.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/img1366-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Port selectio"><figcaption>The port selection isn''t a selling point</figcaption></figure></p><p>Elsewhere, there are no surprises: 4GB of memory, a bigger-than-average 1TB hard disk, 802.11n Wi-Fi and Gigabit Ethernet, with a DVD driver and an SD card reader.

It rotates through 360 degrees, and means these machines can be used in traditional notebook or tablet configurations, as well as in Lenovo''s standing or tented positions.

The Yoga''s aesthetic is simple, but it works: a metal-effect plastic wrist-rest is held in place by a soft-touch black plastic base that gently curves upwards. The lid is a subtle dark colour with a shining Lenovo logo, and the only thing we don''t like is the glossy bezel &ndash; it''s too wide.</p><p>Build quality is mixed. The wrist-rest barely moves, and the underside is similarly strong, but the keyboard''s base is far too flimsy, and the back of the slim screen has too much give &ndash; it twists from side to side, and pressing the back of the panel caused the desktop to flicker.</p><p>Lenovo''s latest machine tips the scales at 1.35kg, and it''s 17.2mm thick. That compares well to rivals &ndash; only the Acer Aspire P3 is lighter &ndash; and it falls in line with some of the smaller Ultrabooks we''ve seen. </p><p>That bodes well for laptop usage, but it''s hardly ideal for the Lenovo''s tablet mode. It''s still twice as thick and heavy as proper tablets and, thanks to that 11.6in screen, it''s a lot wider too.

Our main bone of contention is the keyboard: the flimsy base doesn''t impact much on usage, but the keys themselves are poor. They''ve barely got a millimetre of travel, and each button feels hollow and unsatisfying. It''s fine for tapping out emails, but no good for serious work. There''s also a single-height Return key and no number-pad.</p><p>The keyboard makes itself known during tablet mode, too. Flipping the screen over deactivates the keyboard, but it can still be felt when holding the Yoga in two hands, and everyone who tried this machine found it irritating. We also had issues when flipping the Yoga back to laptop mode &ndash; occasionally the keyboard or trackpad failed to reactivate.</p><p>There''s nothing special about this machine''s port selection: you get single USB 2 and 3 sockets, an SD card reader, a micro-HDMI output and a headphone jack.

When it was first announced, Apple wasn''t close to confirming the existence of a tablet.</p>\n<p>The slates already on the market were both overpriced and terrible. Netbooks were popular, but far from comfortable. The idea behind the JooJoo, originally named the Crunchpad (and the subject of some very tedious legal mudslinging that we''re not going to go into here), was for a low-cost tablet that would give you access to the web from your lap. And that''s what it does.</p>\n<p>There are no apps, except for web-based ones. There''s no pretence at it being a dedicated computer. It really is just the web on your lap.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the JooJoo is yet another demonstration of just how good Apple is at making kit. While it''s far from unusable, it is clunky. It''s slow. It feels cheap, unfinished and unpolished, and it doesn''t come in at a low enough price to justify any of it.</p>\n<p>The problems start as soon as you get your hands on it. The JooJoo is bigger than the iPad, and it has a wider screen, but it''s much less comfortable to hold. The power button requires a fingernail or a pin to press properly.</p>\n<p>The screen doesn''t so much show fingerprints as proudly collect them to display to your friends. During testing, we were constantly reaching for tissues, and not because we were eating buttered toast while playing with the thing.</p>\n<p>When you switch it on, it''ll either be fast to load, or it just won''t. Battery life was between three and five hours, compared to the iPad''s easy 10. The screen gets uncomfortably warm in use as well. Although far from too hot to handle, it''s a far cry from Apple-grade engineering.</p>\n<p><strong>Hitting the web </strong></p>\n<p>Get to the web browser and things improve, slightly. You can''t zoom into pages, and there''s nothing like the iPad''s wonderful system for double-tapping a column to focus on it. Text display is mediocre at best, and scrolling is often jerky.</p>\n<p>Two sizes of keyboard are provided, and both work OK, but not ideally – press a button and then drag your finger off it, for instance, and the key stays pressed.</p>\n<p>The page viewer however is pretty good, providing a decent version of the sites we went to, and it has the bonus feature of being able to handle Flash. Having the ability to drag the keyboard around the screen and out of the way of the box you''re trying to type into is another excellent addition to the device.</p>\n<p>Flash support is the JooJoo''s trump card, but much of the time it just makes it clear why Jobs is so vehemently against it. Video playback is frequently slow and jerky, and don''t get us started on what happened when we tried to watch high-resolution media – a video on www.blip.tv became a slideshow.</p>\n<p>As for games, while point-and-click titles work fine, it''s impossible to ignore that most just weren''t designed for multitouch.</p>\n<p><strong>Two-fingered salute </strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the JooJoo has interface issues as well. To bring up the main menu bar (which includes the URL field and navigation options), you need to swipe down on the screen. If it works, it brings up a fiddly, irritating bar that contains the options. All too frequently though, it doesn''t.</p>\n<p>To actually scroll a page, you need to use two fingers. That doesn''t sound a problem until you have to do it a lot. Loads of these niggling issues get in the way throughout.</p>\n<p>As an informal test, we handed a colleague who''d never used either platform both a JooJoo and an iPad to play with. After a few seconds of squinting, she had the iPad singing and dancing. But just closing a browser window on the JooJoo took several people poking and prodding at it, before they figured out that it involved an upward swipe. Everyone then asked if they could have another play on the iPad.</p>\n<p>That really is the problem. The JooJoo would be fine without Apple''s shadow falling over it. But when the two devices go head to head, it''s not even a fight.</p>\n<p>The JooJoo may be the cheaper option, but with the iPad''s smoother operation, quicker performance, huge variety of apps and better media support, it''s not the best value for money.

There''s a SIM slot for adding an optional 3G card, and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections are both on board.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/thinkpad20tablethero10-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo thinkpad tablet review"></figure></p><p>The most unique feature is the pen, which is thankfully just an optional add-on that enhances the interface in dramatic ways. For most tasks, you can just use finger presses and swipes. Yet, if you want to jot down notes, the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet converts what you write to text quickly and, for the most part, accurately. You can also draw objects in a sketchpad and annotate documents with ease.</p><p>From a design standpoint, the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet feels a bit chunky and is reminiscent of older slate tabs that ran on Windows Tablet PC. That said, unlike the  (known as the Toshiba Thrive in the US), the IPS screen, made of Gorilla Glass and so exceptionally durable, is viewable from a side angle, like the iPad 2''s. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0169-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo thinkpad tablet"></figure></p><p>There are four buttons on the top left-hand side that serve as the screen lock, Web, Back and Home buttons.</p><p>The tablet is loaded with extra software. Lenovo includes the Documents To Go app, which normally costs &pound;9.99 to download. Lenovo says its ThinkPad Tablet is the first Android tab to include the Netflix app - the popular US TV and movie streaming site - on its US models. There are two unique interface add-ons - one is an app launcher that sits in the centre of the screen, and the other is an app wheel that functions just like the app pop-up menu that''s standard with Android.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0175-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo thinkpad tablet review"></figure></p><p>Lenovo advertises its ThinkPad Tablet as "professional grade", and we think that means it''s focused less on the consumer side. That''s a good thing, because one of our overall impressions is that the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet runs slowly for video. </p><p>The Chinese PC maker might be targeting business people with the higher price as well. At &pound;821 for the 32GB model (although currently offered at the discounted price of &pound;580 on the Lenovo website), the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet is one of the most expensive Android tablets around. It may not be worth the high price, but some of the features are definitely business friendly.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/keyboard20folio01-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo thinkpad tablet review"></figure></p><p>In the box, Lenovo includes a charger and USB cable, but no earbuds, case or stand&#8232;&#8232;.</p><p>Taking a tour around the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet, the first impression is that the tablet seems big and bulky. At 748g, it''s heavier than the , at 565g, and the , at 601g. The Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet is even heavier than the , which we described as too bulky.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0193-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo thinkpad tablet review"></figure></p><p>There are ports galore, though. We tested the USB port, which is below the screen on the right, and it worked with a USB keyboard called the Luxeed, and even a wireless mouse from Microsoft. However, the tablet didn''t work with one USB flash drive loaded with music and video files. We tested another flash drive, formatted on the same Windows 7 PC as the first one, and it worked fine.</p><p>Above the USB slot, on the right-hand side, there''s a three-in-one camera flash card reader that works with SD, SDHC, and MMC cards up to 32GB. A docking port, micro USB port (for charging and swapping files) and a mini-HDMI port are also on the left-hand side. The power button is on the top to the left. On the left-hand side, there are volume control buttons and a slot for storing the pen.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/thinkpad20tabletfamily01-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo thinkpad tablet review"></figure></p><p>The 1280 x 800 IPS display, measuring 10.1 inches, like the , looked a bit dull for movie playback and games. At least it is viewable from a side angle, up to 178 degrees, since the technology is the same as the . Like almost every tablet we''ve tried, the screen glare on the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet is obnoxiously bad - the device is barely useable outside.</p><p>Other notable hardware features are here to appease the business user. For example, Lenovo includes an app that you can use to encrypt sensitive business documents stored on flash media. There''s also a handy USB file transfer app that works for copying internal files to an external hard drive or USB flash drive.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0176-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo thinkpad tablet"></figure></p><p>Battery life on the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet is about average for most Android tabs, lasting for around eight hours. In our testing, we experienced all-day usage from sun-up to sun down when we used the device under normal conditions for checking email, browsing the web and playing YouTube clips. </p><p>As expected, when we watched several episodes of <em>The Killing</em> one after the other, with the display turned up bright so we could see what was happening, the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet only lasted for about four hours of continuous playback.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/thinkpad20-20printershare-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo thinkpad tablet review"></figure></p><p>One other hardware perk is that the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet comes with a service called PrinterShare. You install a utility on your PC, select your printer and can then print directly from the tablet - although you have to configure the printer under Settings - over a Wi-Fi network. Of course, the printer has to be on the same network as the tablet. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/thinkpad20tabletstandard05-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo thinkpad tablet"></figure></p> ', '', 'thinkpad20tabletstandard07with20touching20pen-160-80.jpg', 'dsc0169-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'For those with a penchant for tech throwbacks, the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet is a reminder of past', 'For those with a penchant for tech throwbacks, the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet is a reminder of past accomplishments.

The point release includes a few new additions. You can resize widgets and scroll through open apps in the pop-up thumbnails for the "recent apps" list.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/wimage09-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="samsung galaxy tab 10.1" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 doesn''t have a USB port, so it doesn''t take advantage of the new Android 3.1 feature to support USB-connected peripherals which is a shame, but that''s not the direction Samsung is going with this tablet.

Still, the new model has a 3MP rear camera, which is three times higher than the Apple ''s camera. There''s also a front-facing 2MP camera.</p>\n<p>There are quite a few interesting perks and additions on this tablet.

In our tests, it lasted about nine hours for everyday tasks. The Apple  battery is 6600mAh.</p>\n<p>The 10.1 also has a four-way accelerometer and gyro (the Apple  uses a three-way accelerometer and gyro - starting to see a pattern here?). That may seem like a minor upgrade, but most of the games we tested on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 responded faster to quick turns and screen rotations, and generally worked better for controlling games. It also has great side speakers for playing music and movie audio, and plays smooth 1080p video.</p>\n<p>And of course, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 matches the features of other Android tabs: built-in GPS, support for Adobe Flash in the browser (you still have to download it on your own), 1290 x 800 screen resolution, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, the Nvidia Tegra 2 dual-core processor and Android tablet app.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 is a smart buy for anyone who wants a light and portable Android tablet. Google still has a ways to go on apps for Android – there are only a few dozen that are seriously worth downloading, compared to thousands of worthy iOS apps.</p>\n<p>The ecosystem for media is a bit underdeveloped on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 as well. Sure, you can watch movies stream on the web, but for downloads you''re mostly on your own.</p>\n<h4><strong>Update:</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>August 5 2011: </strong>Samsung has now released a software update for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 (the kernel says 2.6.36.3 but the Android OS version is still 3.1).</p>\n<p>The 10.1 now comes with Samsung''s TouchWiz software overlay which is designed to add some more features to Android by building on the foundations that Google laid down.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/popupapps-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="popup" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>There is now a small arrow in the middle of the taskbar at the bottom of the screen. You press that, and can open the new Task Manager (to close and open apps), a Calendar (which uses Google Cal), a World Clock, a Pen Memo widget (for adding notes and drawing), a Calculator, and a Music Player. Each of these works reliably and adds to the value of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 beyond the usual Android 3.1 release on other tabs.

There is also a new app called eBook which lets you read books you have downloaded from other book stores like Kobo, or that you have obtained by other means – such as download a free ePub file.

But it''s a brand the company is determined to stamp on Western consciousnesses over the coming months. </p><p>It slunk into the low-end smartphone market with a series of Android phones a couple of years back, and in November of last year branched out with a noisy press party for the 7-inch MediaPad 7. </p><p>We''ve only just been able to get hold of a review device, so if this is a launch it''s not exactly rushing, but the MediaPad 7 has been worth waiting for. </p><h4>Done right </h4><p>We''re very much tempted to call this ''the  done right''. Even Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has confessed that he personally prefers Android''s flexible openness to Apple''s tightly closed and controlled iOS. And when it comes to form factor, we''ve always thought the iPad was too big and too heavy, and with version 3 it''s even become a little heavier. </p><p>One of our first portable phones was the Motorola Brick. It weighed 790g and was carried around in an enormous black leather bag along with a Sinclair Z88 and a whole bunch of papers. Since then, the definition of portability has changed.</p><p> However, many of us at PC Plus argue that if a thing needs a bag, it''s not portable. In particular, should we consider the iPad to be portable? And what exactly is its function? They''re flying off the shelves, but are defining a product category that''s completely separate from regular work tools like phones, notebooks and desktops. </p><p>The conventional wisdom seems to be that it''s a couch-potato toy, best suited for web browsing, photo viewing and movie watching. But how successful is the iPad and other tablets at achieving this? </p><p>The key problem is the 10-inch form factor insisted upon by Steve Jobs. It makes for a large device too heavy to hold in the hand for any length of time. So you put it on the table or rest it on your lap. In that mode if you want to do any data entry you would be much better off using one of the new breed of Ultrabooks. </p><p>Seven-inch tablets are a much better fit for the human hand. Huawei''s new MediaPad 7, unlike the iPad, is so small that you can comfortably stick it in your inside jacket pocket, making it a fully portable no-brainer. It''s less than half the weight of that Motorola Brick and around a third lighter than the newest iPad. </p><p>Can you do real work with it? You certainly can. Mostly by tapping and sliding on one of the many Android virtual keyboards available. It''s also entirely feasible to mix in short bursts of dictation, which uses servers in the cloud to do the speech-to-text translation.</p><p> On rare occasions when a physical keyboard is needed it''s easy enough to pair the tablet to a decent Bluetooth keyboard such as the ZAGkeys Flex. </p><h4>A big deal </h4><p>Huawei makes much of this being the first Android 3.2 Honeycomb tablet, but that''s not much of a big deal now that Android 4.0, aka Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) has landed. In fact there''s nothing about the MediaPad 7 that''s a big deal. And that, for us, <em>is</em> the big deal. </p><p>It''s a well designed, more-or-less generic Android tablet, of excellent build quality, available with or without HSPA+, that will do everything you''d expect from this class of device. The aluminium body has a solid, creak-free feel and we particularly like the way access to the SIM and SD cards is concealed behind one of a pair of triangular black panels. </p><p>The two tiny speakers on the top edge in portrait mode create a surprisingly convincing stereo soundscape at close range, although they''d be more useful for movie-watching on opposite edges in landscape orientation. </p><p>The pre-installed software is sparse. Aside from the mandatory mission-critical <em>Angry Birds</em>, the only standout is Huawei Office, a Microsoft compatible spreadsheet, word processing and presentation package. But Android Market (recently renamed Google Play) is there to fill in with everything you might need. </p><p>We grabbed Google Docs right away (the newest version is a revelation) along with the Go Keyboard, and the indispensible TuneIn Radio. </p><p>Admittedly, tablets aren''t quite there yet as a full-blown work tool, but the Huawei MediaPad 7 takes a big step forward towards convincing us this is the form factor of the future. If it has a challenger it would be the easier to hold and even smaller - but no less capable and considerably more costly - 5.3-inch . </p> ', '', 'pcp322.ot04.huaweimediapad-160-80.jpg', '', NULL, 'Huge in China, here in the UK Huawei is a name you might be tempted to pronounce ''who are we''.', 'Huge in China, here in the UK Huawei is a name you might be tempted to pronounce ''who are we''.

The only problem is the operating system is well out of date and, more importantly, there''s no sign of Google Play.</p><p> Although this is one of the more pricey budget Android tablets, you get a fair amount for your cash. There''s a 1,024 x 600 capacitive touchscreen, while power is provided by a Qualcomm 1.4GHz Snapdragon processor and 512MB of RAM. </p><p>Unfortunately though, the ZTE Light Tab 2 is saddled with Google''s Android 2.3 Gingerbread operating system, rather than the tablet-focused Honeycomb or Ice Cream Sandwich iterations. Gingerbread was released in 2010 and ported to tablets from smartphones, and there''s no getting away from the fact it seems dated. </p><p>Interestingly, the ZTE Light Tab will allow you to insert a SIM card for 3G and, if you''re so inclined, phone calls. Holding it to your ear is a little bit impractical though, given the 202 x 122 x 13mm dimensions. </p><p>At 395g the ZTE Light Tab isn''t heavy, but the BlackBerry Playbook and Tablo are lighter and therefore easier to use long-term. Some may argue that a little extra weight adds a sense of quality to a gadget, and the ZTE certainly feels strong and well constructed. </p><p>There''s a fairly thick bezel wrapped around the screen, with touch-sensitive Android buttons for Home, Menu and Back. The rear of the tablet features a matte plastic covering that comes away to reveal the 3,400mAh Li-Ion battery and slots for a SIM and MicroSD card.</p><p> With only 4GB of on-board storage, half of which is taken up with the OS and pre-installed apps, you''ll want to accessorise the ZTE Light Tab 2 with a MicroSD card if you want to store your media collection. </p><p>The ZTE Light Tab 2 handles media well. The smaller size might not be to everyone''s taste, but it''s perfectly serviceable for small bursts of entertainment.

The fact that the ZTE doesn''t come with it is a black mark on its record. </p><p>It comes with lots of pre-installed apps, including some good ones like Documents to Go (an Office app), FM radio, email and several games, but with no option of adding more, this tablet has a limited lifespan. </p><p>If you''re less keen on apps and are instead looking for a device for watching media and browsing on the move, the ZTE Light Tab is a good choice.

Pull it out and the device stands all by itself, allowing you to kick back and enjoy a video or album - why haven''t we seen this on other media tablets?</p>\n<p>The 70 internet tablet''s higher resolution capacitive screen is a big selling point, stepping up the pixel count from 800 x 400 on the original Archos 70 to 1,024 x 600.</p>\n<h4>Just like Honey</h4>\n<p>Honeycomb is a step up from the Gingerbread OS that dominates sub-£200 tablets. Google designed this version specifically for tablets - and it shows. You get five home screens to fill with widgets and apps as well as the option to customise background, sounds and layout.</p>\n<p>Although the 8GB of on-board storage limits the amount of media you can load onto the 70, there''s a built-in MicroSD card slot for bulking it up.</p>\n<p>An ARM Cortex A8 processor running at 1.2GHz and supported by 512MB of RAM is nestled inside. These specs are enough to produce a reliable, if not lightning-fast, experience. There are hints of lag when moving between homescreens or opening applications but we never experienced a freeze.</p>\n<p>Given the pocket-friendly size, connectivity is limited to a Mini-USB and Mini-HDMI ports, along with the aforementioned MicroSD card slot.

When we looped some high-definition footage, the 70 internet tablet ran for 206 minutes before giving out.

So far, so good.</p>\n<p>Setting up the TEAC NS-X1 to work wirelessly with AirPlay is relatively straightforward: you have to dig fairly deep into its menu system to get to the relevant settings and there''s a bit of tedious entry of Wi-Fi router passwords and so on, but that just seems to be way things are with AirPlay, and TEAC''s effort is no worse (or better) than a lot of other systems out there.</p>\n<p>True, navigating your way through the menus can be slow, but the interface is logically laid out for the most part - and the chrome ring four-way cursor controls on the remote do a pretty good job of easing the pain.

Rather than putting the dock connector on the top where the device would be unsupported and would spoil the line of the Contour 100Di, you press the corner of the panel next to ''Pure'', and the dock rotates out smoothly. It''s commendably robust too, and feels like it would last for years.</p>\n<p>The little rubber nub you can see halfway up the speaker in the picture above acts as a rest for the iPhone or iPod to lean against so it feels secure, and even when you put an iPad into the dock, the whole setup is really stable.</p>\n<p>There are other good design touches as well; the remote control, for example, latches magnetically into a recess on the back. Ironically, though, the remote itself is a bad design; the grid of buttons is undifferentiated, making it impossible to identify functions by touch alone.</p>\n<h4>It all sounds good</h4>\n<p>We''ve been listening to Pure radios for years, and this new model sounds just like its older siblings.

Note that it never sounds like it''s struggling - rather, it''s almost like the radio has decided to be very good at calmly and clearly reproducing the speech of Radio 4, say, and finds Radio 1 just a trifle brash. Imagine Jeeves singing Rihanna, if you will.</p>\n<p>Regardless, nobody would call the audio from this as anything other than good. It doesn''t match our Tap! Top 50-listed Logitech S715i for pure music fidelity and richness, but it is overall a great speaker dock for the bedroom, kitchen or small lounge - and remember that it also works well with an iPad.</p>\n<p>Yes, you could add digital radio stations to just about any dock with an app such as TuneIn Radio, but we like just being able quickly to switch on the radio rather than tapping through an app. We like this.

This is almost £300 more than the basic Apple iPad 2 and £10 more (based on the higher price) than the highest specced 64GB Wi-Fi + 3G iPad 2 - figures that are hard to overlook.</p>\n<h4><strong>Features</strong></h4>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0239-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Orange tahiti review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Despite a number of key players having moved away from the basic 7-inch tablet size, and with 7.7, 8.2 and 8.9-inch devices currently flooding the smaller tablet market, the Orange Tahiti has parked itself firmly in the market of the ultra-portable, just about pocket-manageable form factor.</p>\n<p>The Orange Tahiti boasts a highly desirable finish, with brushed aluminium casing stylishly offset on the rear by a pair of round-edged black plastic triangles. The top triangle holds the tablet''s camera and 3G antenna, while the lower one acts as a well-disguised removable back plate, enabling easy access to the SIM card and microSD slots.</p>\n<p>A well-styled and manufactured device, the Orange Tahiti offers no bend or flex when put under extreme pressure, and has no unsightly seams, joins or construction blemishes. The only form tainting to this otherwise impressive design is the volume control button, which sits loosely in its mount and rattles on occasion when moving the device.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/orange20tahiti-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Orange tahiti review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>It boasts mini HDMI and micro USB connection ports as well as the standard power and 3.5mm audio jack connectors.</p>\n<p>Far from the thinnest tablet on the market, the Orange Tahiti''s 10.5mm thick, softly curved-edged body and 400g weight combine to make a tablet that is extremely comfortable in the hand. The 7-inch form ensures that the tablet can be held and carried in one hand with no uncomfortable or nagging wrist ache, even after hours of continued use.</p>\n<p>More than just a pretty package, the Orange Tahiti features a bevy of high-end innards that in some cases far exceed the expectations of a device crafted specifically for a network provider.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0248-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Orange tahiti review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Thanks to a 1.2GHz dual-core CPU, the Orange Tahiti packs a hefty processing punch, more powerful than the 1GHz dual-core offering found in the  yet still slower than the 1.4GHz monster residing in its more direct rival, the .</p>\n<p>Some 8GB of internal storage sees the Orange Tahiti sport the same amount of inbuilt content space as the currently US-exclusive .

It looks like a Kindle-esque, novel-sized tab squeezed inbetween the iPhone and iPad.', '&#160;', '<p>Catch a glimpse of the Disgo 7000 and you''d be forgiven for thinking that Apple had discovered yet another form-factor and wedged a product into that gap. It looks like a Kindle-esque, novel-sized tab squeezed inbetween the iPhone and iPad.</p>\n<p>Given the company''s impeccable sense of style, that a sub-£100 Android tablet could be mentioned in the same breath is quite a compliment to Disgo''s budget gadget.</p>\n<p>The resemblance is undeniable, though. Sitting idle it has the same seamless black bevel and glossy, fingerprint-attracting sheen as Apple''s touchscreen devices. It''s only when you flip the 7000 over to reveal the matt plastic reverse side that the disparity in manufacturing cost is revealed.</p>\n<p>This is a handsome piece of kit that unashamedly imitates more expensive technology. It''s also a convenient size – at 10.5mm thick it''s slimmer than the majority of budget clunkers we''ve seen so far.</p>\n<p>The modest proportions mean it''s more like an e-book reader than an iPad, but that makes it comfortable to hold, convenient for reading and easy to stow in a bag. It''s also flattering to the 800 x 480 pixel screen which is a much lower resolution for a 7" tablet, as most have a 1024 x 600 panel.</p>\n<p>Of course it doesn''t leave a great deal of space for physical buttons. The back button is front and centre below the screen, but the power, home, menu and volume buttons are arranged along the narrow right-hand side of the device as you hold it in portrait, which can lead to the odd accidental press as you''re getting to grips with the device.</p>\n<p>Battery life is also unspectacular, though not atrocious, finally giving up the ghost after three hours of video at full brightness.</p>\n<h4>Making a connection</h4>\n<p>Connectivity is generous. There''s a MicroSD port to bolster the tiny 4GB of internal storage (a card is all but essential if you want to add music and videos to the device) and mini HDMI to allow you to watch videos on an attached TV.</p>\n<p>The most surprising feature is that there is not just one mini USB port but two at the base of the device. The one positioned in the centre is a standard connector, for plugging the tablet into a computer. The second one, offset to the right, is a USB host controller and works with an adaptor included in the box.</p>\n<p>The dongle turns it into a USB port like you''d find on a laptop. This means if you have media stored on a standard USB stick you can view it on the tablet and if you tire of typing on a touchscreen, you can plug in a USB keyboard to ease the pain. It''s a thoughtful addition that makes the device far more flexible for the newcomers than tablets in this price range will surely attract.</p>\n<h4>At what cost?</h4>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/wlt160.solo.tablet021-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Disgo tablet 7000 review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>At that price there are always going to be sacrifices though, and the two biggest ones are par for the course when it comes to tablets in this class.</p>\n<p>The first is a hardware limitation: the Disgo 7000 has a resistive rather than capacitive touchscreen. What this means that you can only press in one place at a time, meaning no multi-touch trickery like pinching to zoom, and it does make typing much more laborious.</p>\n<p>As for the 7000''s own performance, it''s relatively accurate, meaning you''ll rarely hit the wrong letter on the on-screen keyboard, but you do have to press quite hard to get a response at all, which is very frustrating. You''ll often see that unnerving LCD discolouration as you push down on the display and typing anything more than quick notes is likely to become pretty tiresome.</p>\n<p>The second problem is one of software, as the Disgo 7000 features the ageing Android 2.3 ''Gingerbread'' OS. While it remains functional for straightforward things like web browsing, email and media (and is an improvement on Android 2.2 which stinks up many of the other budget tabs), it''s still old technology.</p>\n<p>More worrying is the lack of the Android Marketplace – owing to licensing costs, you won''t find a sub-£100 Android tab that has Marketplace support and that seriously limits your options.</p>\n<p>It''s by no means the end of apps – Disgo attempts to mitigate the loss of Marketplace by including the GetJar downloader which features many of the more popular apps such as Facebook, Twitter and Skype. But there''s no denying that the vast majority of Android apps, particularly the paid ones, simply can''t be downloaded. This means no <em>Angry Birds</em>, no BBC iPlayer and certainly no <em>Cut The Rope</em>.</p>\n<p>If you''re yet to be convinced by the tablet revolution and unsure of whether you need something that sits between a smartphone and a laptop in your life, the Disgo 7000 presents an ideal way to dip your toe in. For around £75 you''re getting a tablet that not only performs the basic functions you''d hope for, but also one that you wouldn''t be ashamed to leave sitting on the coffee table when a friend dropped by.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, you''re sacrificing performance and features, but you''re talking about a device that costs around a sixth of the price of the Samsung Galaxy Tab. Don''t expect it to compete with an iPad or the Samsung Galaxy, but if you''re terrified by the price tags attached to bijou technology, the Disgo 7000 is a modest but desirable tablet that punches well above its weight.</p>\n<p class="webonly">Follow TechRadar Reviews on Twitter:</p>', '', 'wlt160.solo.tablet011-160-80.jpg', '', NULL, 'Catch a glimpse of the Disgo 7000 and you''d be forgiven for thinking that Apple had discovered', 'Catch a glimpse of the Disgo 7000 and you''d be forgiven for thinking that Apple had discovered yet another form-factor and wedged a product into that gap.

Both are Android 3.2 tablets, with a 1.2GHz dual-core processor, a 1280 x 800 screen (yep, it''s the same despite the different sizes) and 16GB of storage.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/xoom2mediaeditionfronthorizmovie-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola xoom 2 media edition"></figure></p><p>Well, there are a couple of other differences, we confess. As you might expect, a reduction in size also means a reduction in weight, and the Xoom 2 Media Edition weighs just 388g &ndash; even lighter than the Kindle Fire, which weighs in at 413g, and a lot lighter than the 599g of its big brother. </p><p>And, being smaller, the battery has had a big reduction in size in the Media Edition. In fact, it''s been nearly halved from 7000mAh in the Xoom 2 to 3900mAh in the Media Edition, a drop that''s reflected in the quoted battery life of 6 hours browsing over Wi-Fi.</p><p>There''s also one notable loss when it comes to software: the impressive Floating Notes app is absent from the Media Edition. We realise that Motorola is making a point that the smaller tablet is more for home media use (hence the name), but since apps such as Citrix and Evernote are still present, we don''t see why Floating Notes couldn''t also have been including.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/in-hand-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola xoom 2 media edition"></figure></p><p>As you might expect, the price is different between the two models, too. The Media Edition comes in at around &pound;319 &ndash; a marked saving over the 10.1-inch Xoom 2, or the likes of the iPad 2 or .</p><p>Like the bigger Xoom 2, there''s a five-megapixel camera on the back, capable of recording 720p HD footage, and a 1.3-megapixel camera on the front. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/front-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola xoom 2 media edition"></figure></p><p>Unlike the bigger Xoom 2, though, it''s pretty clear the Media Edition is intended to be used in portrait mode most of the time. Where the 10.1-inch version had its cameras, ports and infrared transmitter on the long edges of the device, with the controls on the short edge, the opposite is true here. The front-facing camera sits at the top short edge, like the iPad 2, with the controls on the long edge to the right.</p><p>Apart from this subtle change, the design of the Xoom 2 Media Edition stays really rather close to the 10.1-inch version. It''s the same shape, with the same cut-outs in the corners. </p><p>They''re as good as the same thickness, with the Media Edition coming in at 8.9mm thick (0.1mm thicker than the Xoom 2) and made of the same matte plastic, meaning that Media Edition is just as comfortable to hold the big Xoom 2, except it''s much lighter &ndash; a winning combination.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/side-on-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola xoom 2 media edition"></figure></p><p>Unfortunately, the front screen is still an appalling fingerprint magnet. The Xoom 2 was one of the worst we''ve seen for picking up smudges and grease, and things are no different here.</p><p>On the top edge of the Media Edition, you have the infrared transmitter and 3.5mm headphone jack, as well as a couple of speaker grilles. On the bottom of the device are the micro-USB and micro-HDMI ports, and another speaker grille. You''ve also got a flap that opens, but like the flap on the big Xoom 2, it goes nowhere. No SIM card slot and no microSD slot.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ports-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola xoom 2 media edition"></figure></p><p>On the back you''ll find the main camera and a shinier backplate that''s actually held on with screws. Screws! We can''t remember the last time we saw them so prominently on&hellip; anything, really, but they suit the look of the materials Motorola''s used.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/back-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola xoom 2 media edition"></figure></p><p>We only really have one issue with the Xoom 2''s design, and that''s the ridiculous placement of the Lock key and volume buttons. The big Xoom 2 has them hidden on the device''s curves, much like the iPad 2, but on the Media Edition they''re effectively on the back of the device.</p><p>This means that if the Xoom 2 Media Edition is on a table with it''s screen off, there''s no way to turn it on without picking it up. It may not seem like the biggest deal, but it really annoyed us, especially since it''s compounded by the fact that these buttons actually aren''t that easy to find and press without looking at them even if you are holding the tablet.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/side20buttons-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Motorola xoom 2 media edition"></figure></p><p>Tablets should be pick-up-and-go devices.

The new iPad is nearly 60g heavier than the second iteration, and while it''s not terrible, it does add a little arm strain during a marathon movie session.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ipad4-handson2-01-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="New iPad 4 review"></figure></p><p>Sometimes you become accustomed to the weight of a device if you use it enough, and then the whole debacle becomes a completely none issue.</p><p>However the weight of the iPad 4 is still noticeable even a few months after first get</p><p>ting it - pick it up and hold it for the duration of a movie and that unmistakable heft is still there to haunt you.</p><h3>Retina Display</h3><p>Before we get onto all the normal insight over the frame of the new iPad 4, it''s worth talking about one top feature: the Retina Display.</p><p>Apple has packed a huge amount more pixels into the 9.7-inch screen - 1536 x 2048 to be exact. However, despite the fact that the Cupertino brand makes a big thing about the 330 PPI density of the , we''re looking at a screen that''s technically a lot less sharp than its smartphone brethren - around 264PPI.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ipad4-handson2-02-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="New iPad 4 review"></figure></p><p>Apple has got around this fact by stating that the screen is meant to be held 15 inches from the face, rather than the 10 inches the iPhone is supposed to be from your eyes, and as such the sharpness is the same.</p><p>Given the fact the term ''Retina Display'' really isn''t a legally binding term, we don''t care. What matters is the effect - and it''s one of the most impressive we''ve seen on a tablet to date. If someone took an iPad, printed out a really hi-res image of an iOS system and stuck it on the front, we''d struggle to tell the difference - it''s superb, and even squinting up close you''ll be hard pushed to notice any pixelation.</p><p>The colour reproduction will also appeal to many, as it''s pretty close to reality - it lacks the punch of the Super AMOLED HD screens seen on the likes of the  for instance, but it will depend on personal preference as to whether that''s a good thing. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ipad4-handson2-18-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="New iPad 4 review"></figure></p><p>We like the vivid colours of Samsung''s screens, but we know plenty of people that loathe them too.</p><p>The main thing is things like internet browsing; photo viewing and movie sessions are all much, much improved over the iPad 2, and is one of the main reasons to pick up the new iPad.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>The new iPad, as we said, is only marginally thicker and a little heavier than the iPad 2, and if you pick it up with no knowledge of the former, you''ll likely be mighty impressed.</p><p>The rest of the design is premium too - given you can be paying nearly &pound;700 / $AU900 for a top end model, it needs to seem like a worthwhile investment, and it does.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ipad4-press-01-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="new ipad review"></figure></p><p>There''s also the new Lightning connector on offer, which brings the smaller, faster port for all your needs... unless your need is to use you recently purchased dock, in which case you''ll need to fork out for an adaptor.</p><p>The curved edges, the oleophobic scratch-proof glass and the aluminium chassis are all the kind of thing that some Android tablets have tried to ape and failed.

It''s handy in meetings, too. It''s particularly good for mobile working when you only need to check and write emails or give a quick presentation. The battery ', '', ' <p>The Dell Latitude 10 is an Intel Atom powered tablet that''s designed as a robust device that can be used both with a keyboard and mouse (there''s a USB port on the side) or as a standard slate tablet.</p><p> It runs full-blown , unlike Microsoft''s , which runs the cut-down  that can''t run full desktop apps. The Latitude 10, however, is completely happy with most desktop apps, but it''s hardly a powerhouse, with a dual-core 1.8GHz Atom under the hood. </p><p>Performance is fine for basic use, such as sending mails and flicking through tweets, and the 2GB of memory is a sign that this isn''t a device intended for powerhouse computing. Speed is also helped by the use of a SSD drive, though this means that storage space is compromised - it''s strictly in the tablet territory. </p><p>However, more intensive desktop work can be a trifle slow. And that''s a shame, because the Latitude 10 is worth the &pound;450/$530 that the basic 32GB model costs - in relation to many tablets, especially other Intel Atom-based Windows 8 devices such as the , although that does come with 64GB of storage and a detachable keyboard as standard. </p><h3>Storage woes </h3><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/win10.desirerev3.delllatitudeflat-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Latitude 10"></figure></p><p>Storage is one of the big challenges with Windows 8 tablets and the 32GB provided with the entry-level Latitude 10 doesn''t provide a huge amount of headroom over and above a full Windows 8 install and you''ll quickly find that your drive has filled up. A full PC replacement this definitely isn''t. </p><p>And while Windows 8-style apps are usually pretty lean in terms of size, once you''ve downloaded a few of them, you''ll soon find yourself running out of room to store them all. However, a 64 GB version is available, which also features a swappable battery (it''s this version Dell sent us for review). </p><p>The standard battery is a two cell 3,880mAh version, while there''s a whopping 7,760mAh four-cell version you can choose. The swappable battery could be really useful, although you might not need it - even when stressed we got around seven to eight hours from the standard battery, while on idle you can expect it to last well into the teens in terms of hours. This is where the lower power Atom processor has a distinct benefit. </p><p>As you might have guessed from the name, the Latitude 10 boasts a 10.1-inch display. It has a reasonable resolution at 1,366 x 768, though if you''ve used one you''ll really notice the difference compared to a retina display iPad, for example. It''s certainly great for use with Windows 8 apps and you can swipe between things easily. </p><h3>Business focused </h3><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/win10.desirerev3.delllatitudeback-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Latitude 10"></figure></p><p>The Latitude 10 is a trifle lighter than the iPad at 648g and, as such, feels like a really pleasant device to use in the hand, with a smooth, tactile finish that won''t fingerprint like many glossy finishes. You can have any colour, as long as it''s black. </p><p>A dock is also available for the Latitude 10 that offers a really solid charging stand for your tablet as well as Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI and extra USB ports. A soft case is also available for it, too. </p><p>The dock hints at the business-orientated use for this device - Latitude is Dell''s business mobile computing brand, after all. The business connection isn''t just in terms of the name and robust appearance. The 64GB model boasts a TPM (Trusted Platform Module), which is a business-orientated feature designed to prevent unauthorised changes to the operating system. </p><h3>Verdict</h3><p>So can we recommend the Latitude 10? Yes, but with one key caveat - it is not a laptop replacement if you do intensive tasks of any sort. A workhorse PC it is not. We certainly wouldn''t recommend its use on a desk as a PC replacement, but it is handy as a second desk screen for keeping an eye on social feeds or email. And it''s handy in meetings, too. </p><p>But what it is great for is keeping in touch when you''re out of the office, when you only need to check and write emails or give a quick presentation. The battery life is simply stunning. </p><p>But when buying a tablet at this price point, there are still better options out there, such as the Microsoft . It''s a full-blown Windows 8 tablet, too (albeit with Windows 8 Pro) but it features a Core i5 processor instead. That means it really is capable of being your main display (it does still only come with 32GB of storage, however).

Its physical keyboard comes combined as part of what it calls the "coverboard", and is basically a lid that sits flush with the tablet''s screen, using magnets, creating a netbook-like effect.</p>\n<p>A very skinny netbook that is, since the tablet part of the Archos 101 XS is just 8mm thick, with the coverboard only adding a further 5mm. When you consider that its direct rival, the , measures a combined 20.1mm, its 13mm waistline is all the more appealing.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/archos2010120xs20left-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Archos 101 XS review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>At almost 400g (0.88lbs) lighter than the budget Asus machine as well, it''s definitely a much more portable friendly setup. On its own, the Archos 101 XS tablet weighs 630g (1.39lbs), and the coverboard only adds a further 270g (0.60lbs) to the mix.</p>\n<p>But unlike Asus''s hybrid tabs, which offer clever keyboard docks that expand connectivity and enhance battery life, the coverboard is pretty poor in comparison. Its only port is a micro USB one, which is used for charging the tablet when docked. When not connected to the mains, the Archos 101 XS''s keyboard drains power from the tablet''s battery.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/archos2010120xs200015-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Archos 101 XS review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>And the build quality, not just of the dock, but of the whole device, is nowhere near on par with its competitors. Starting with the dock, its thinness works against it, feeling very weak, with plenty of flex and incredibly plasticy.</p>\n<p>The keyboard keys have an incredibly shallow travel, so typing for long periods of time isn''t too comfortable. And the kick-stand, which pops up to hold the tablet in place for typing sessions, is incredibly feeble.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/archos2010120xs200016-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Archos 101 XS review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In its most upright position it will hold the tablet in place - just - but try to adjust the angle (although we''re not entirely sure you''re supposed to) and you''ll run into trouble, with it giving way under the weight of the slate.</p>\n<p>The method used to hold the coverboard and the tablet together, using magnets, is also pretty basic. Sure, the twist motion that Asus suggests to separate the two pulls them apart easily enough but, on more than one occasion, we pulled the Archos 101 XS out of our bags only to find the tablet wasn''t sitting flush with its partner.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/archos2010120xs20front-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Archos 101 XS review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The tab itself also suffers from appearing ''cheap''. The white plastic edges don''t exactly blend into the mock (plastic, of course) brushed metal finish, and the lip between the silver trim and the 10.1-inch display is pretty sharp. It''s a build that is also massively susceptible to scuffs and scratches - ours was a bit of a mess after only a short while of regular use and transportation.</p>\n<p>The volume rocker and the power button, positioned on the bottom-right corner, are incredibly thin and fiddly to use, and the speaker grill up front is pretty incongruous.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/archos2010120xs200018-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Archos 101 XS review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>On the left-hand side is your port activity. You''ll find a mini HDMI port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a micro USB port and a microSD slot awkwardly positioned here. The bottom edge contains the dock connector and a couple of magnets.</p>\n<p>The display is a TFT (MVA) one with a respectable 1280 x 800 resolution. Although, while the pixel count is on a par with its similarly priced rivals, the quality falls a little short. Even on full brightness the display is pretty lifeless, and the glossy finish makes it incredibly susceptible to fingerprints and smudges.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/archos2010120xs200030-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Archos 101 XS review" /></figure>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>There''s no auto-brightness function, which is a little odd for an Android tablet, but you''ll most likely want the lights on full anyway.</p>\n<p>Onboard storage is 16GB, and you can expand this by up to 128GB using the microSD option.

Well, we''ve spent some serious time with Fujitsu''s new baby in order to find out exactly that.</p><h3>Features</h3><p>Fujitsu has opted for a 10.1-inch form factor with the Fujitsu Stylistic M532, and has kept the chassis down to a pleasingly slim 8.6mm (0.34 inches). That''s as thick as the , and the new iPad - at 9.4mm thick - is portly by comparison.</p><p> Luckily, there''s no hidden weight anywhere, and the Fujitsu Stylistic M532 tips the scales at only 560g (1.23lbs). In one hand this weight becomes noticeable after a time, but if you''re using both it''s light as a feather. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p7120006-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Fujitsu Stylistic M532 review"></figure></p><p>The back of the tablet has been given a soft, rubberised plastic coating, similar to the one found on the reverse of the . This doesn''t look as attractive as the aluminium of the new iPad, or even budget machines such as the , but we can''t argue with the functionality. The rubbery black coating is easy to grip, and you won''t find it getting covered with smudgy fingerprints, either. That''s just the screen. </p><p>There''s only so much you can do with the aesthetics of a tablet, but Fujitsu has thrown a little of its trademark red onto the Fujitsu Stylistic M532 by way of a trim around the outside. The jury''s out as to whether this cheapens the look of the tablet, but in our opinion it adds a good design touch that helps to differentiate it from the legions of similar devices.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/stylistic20m53220press20shot201-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Fujitsu Stylistic M532 review"></figure></p><p>Thanks to Android 4.0''s soft key arrangement, there aren''t any physical buttons on the front of the Fujitsu Stylistic M532, and this really helps make it look better. The bezel isn''t tiny, but then it isn''t massive either &ndash; just big enough for the Fujitsu branding at the bottom of the tablet and the front-facing 2.0MP camera lens at the top.</p><p>In fact, the only buttons you''ll find on the entire tablet are the on/off switch on the top of the device and the volume up/down on the right-hand side. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p7120007-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Fujitsu Stylistic M532 review"></figure></p><p>Below the volume controls is the micro USB port and space for a micro SIM card and microSD storage expansion. Yes, that''s right &ndash; the Fujitsu Stylistic M532 features both 3G connectivity and microSD storage. These are two features often overlooked on the majority of tablets, and the fact that Fujitsu has included them is enough to merit a slow, appreciative nod of the head on our part.</p><p>Even without the microSD card, you still get 32GB of SSD storage inside the Fujitsu Stylistic M532, which is generous for the price.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/stylistic20m53220press20shot203-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Fujitsu Stylistic M532 review"></figure></p><p>The only other connection, besides the 3.5mm headphone jack, is the Fujitsu proprietary port on the base of the tablet, used for charging and the like. The hope is that, <em>&agrave; la</em> Apple, we might see some docking stations and other peripherals that take advantage of this before the year is through.</p><p>Given that the screen is about the most important part of any tablet, how does the Fujitsu''s hold up to scrutiny? Quite well, as it happens. The 10.1-inch Gorilla Glass display has a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution and excellent viewing angles. All the .MOV, .AVI and .MKV files we threw at it played perfectly, and we were able to settle down for a couple of hours with several HD episodes of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/browser20in20hand-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Fujitsu Stylistic M532 review"></figure></p><p>However, as ever, the glossy screen ran into trouble when we watched in bright light. And although the brightness on the Fujitsu Stylistic M532 can be boosted, it wasn''t enough for outside viewing.</p><p>Even so, you''ll get a lot of viewing time from the Fujitsu Stylistic M532. Fujitsu quotes the lithium polymer battery inside the tablet will give you 9.5 hours of usage.

Available in either "titanium grey" or "champaign gold", the metal adds an undeniably premium feel even if the grip isn''t as good as the dimpled rear surface of the Nexus 7.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/fonepad-handson-09-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Asus Fonepad review"></figure></p><p>Asus has located the power button and the volume rocker on the left edge near the top of the tablet. The edge of the device is tapered and the buttons are set fairly close to the chassis, so hitting them in a hurry isn''t always easy. Similarly, given the smoothness of the back, it can be a bit tricky adjusting volume with your thumb if you''re holding the tablet one-handed with your left mitt.</p><p>The FonePad''s 16:9 aspect ratio means its easy to grip around the back for anyone with small or medium sized hands. You''ll be able to curl your fingers around the edge and hold it comfortably, rather than having to resort to holding it by one corner and obscuring part of the screen.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/fonepad-handson-20-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Asus Fonepad review"></figure></p><p>Naturally though, the tablet works best when gripped with both hands in a landscape mode. If you''re gaming or watching the latest <em>Game of Thrones</em>, chances are you''ll be holding it this way and the FonePad sits very nicely in a two-handed grip. </p><p>We mentioned that tablet manufacturers cut corners in the early days and some of that still survives - cost is cost, after all. The FonePad doesn''t feature a rear-facing camera, so the back of the chassis is completely clean. By way of markings, you''ll find an embossed Asus logo and the familiar Intel Inside mark at the bottom of the tablet.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/fonepad-handson-18-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Asus Fonepad review"></figure></p><p>If there''s one thing as bad as holding a tablet up to make a phone call, it''s holding a tablet up to take a picture. We feel fairly safe in saying here that the omission of a rear-facing camera is no great loss. If you''re absolutely desperate for one, pick up the US version of the FonePad - that''s got a 3MP rear-facing camera built in.</p><p>The only two ports on the device are the micro USB port and the 3.5mm headphone jack. These are both found on the bottom of the tablet with the headphone jack to the left of the charging port. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/fonepad-handson-10-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Asus Fonepad review"></figure></p><p>Weighing in at 340g, the FonePad is slightly heavier than Apple''s 308g iPad mini - but in day-to-day terms this slight extra bulk is barely noticeable. Part of the attraction of 7-inch tablets is undeniably the lighter load and you''ll have no trouble holding this tablet one-handed while watching videos, or indeed, making a call.</p><p>If Asus does want to best Apple''s effort, it can point to screen resolution as one way of doing that. The 1,280 x 800 resolution panel on the FonePad display benefits from an LED backlight with IPS technology and is exceptionally clear. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/fonepad-handson-08-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Asus Fonepad review"></figure></p><p>It won''t usurp the 10-inch tablets for screen clarity but the contrast ratio and colour balance certainly looked all right to us and is more than serviceable for enjoying a movie or game on the move.</p><p>Unfortunately, the problem with premium metallic finishes and beautiful TFT-coated screens is the susceptibility to dust and scratches. It''s no different here and the FonePad is certain to come off worse against keys and loose change if you leave it unprotected in your backpack. Our advice?

So while it''s a bit big to hold in one hand with your fingers wrapped around the sides (you end up holding it like a book instead, gripping the front with your thumb, the back resting on your fingers, and trying to stop the device sliding out of your mitts), it''s a pleasure to not have to keep swapping paws like with some other devices.</p><p>At 338g, it''s two grams lighter than the Nexus 7 and about 30 heavier than the iPad Mini.

That''s higher than the (some would say pretty rubbish) 163 ppi given by the iPad mini over a fractionally smaller screen. </p><p>This makes it pretty good for looking at most things - especially because Samsung devices often offer vivid colour representation.

Then, since the ThinkPad Tablet 2 can''t go clamshell like a laptop, a case of some sort is a good idea. Lenovo sells a slick one for $39.99/&pound;25. That means you''re paying $848/&pound;564 for the tablet and keyboard, $888/&pound;590 if you spring for the case, too.</p><p>That''s a stiff asking price for a dock and slate, a design that we''re honestly not sold on as anything but a travel device. It''s hard to stomach a full computing cost for what''s really a secondary computing solution.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovothinkpad27-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 review"><figcaption>Bluetooth syncing is perfect, but the dock''s grip is less so</figcaption></figure></p><p>Still, we would say that the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 is the best take we''ve seen on this design. It''s a functional jack of all trades that can keep you productive and entertained on the road, but its limitations will drive you nuts if you try to make it your only computing option. A fat bank account and good Bluetooth mouse are needed to make this ThinkPad part of your digital life.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>At 10.1 x 6.9 inches, the ThinkPad Tablet 2 has a manageable form factor. Its matte black finish looks great and has a grippy, slightly rubberized quality that makes it a pleasure to hold. It feels a little wide for typing when using the on-screen keyboard, but it''s an excellent size and shape for watching videos in landscape orientation, or reading in portrait. It weighs just a little over a pound, about 544 grams, so it won''t weigh you down much.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovothinkpad28-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 review"><figcaption>A great size for videos</figcaption></figure></p><p>A full-sized USB 2.0 port and a microSD slot make sharing media a synch. Both are hidden beneath rubber tabs to keep out dust and give the tablet a seamless appearance.There''s also a mini-USB connection that''s only for charging.</p><p>The volume rocker is on the upper right side, in easy thumbing range when watching videos in landscape mode. Below it there''s a thoughtful touch; a button that toggles auto-rotate on and off, letting you easily lock the screen.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovothinkpad15-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 review"><figcaption>MicroSD and cell support are handy</figcaption></figure></p><p>Next to the microSD port there''s slot for a full-sized SIM card slot. Lenovo plans to market a version of ThinkPad Tablet 2 with LTE from AT&amp;T in the United States. There''s also a Wacom stylus tucked away on the top left. As always, a stylus is a highly situational accessory, and it stays nicely out of the way when not needed. There''s also mini-HDMI on the bottom, and a proprietary port for docking with additional Lenovo accessories.</p><p>All in all it''s a strong showing of ports, though the number of mini-ports is disappointing. Nobody likes carrying dongles.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovothinkpad26-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2"><figcaption>The stylus helps in desktop mode</figcaption></figure></p><p>As a tablet, the ThinkPad Tablet 2 is a attractive and well built, but it rather dependent on pricey accessories to become the complete package. This is a Windows 8 device with all the compatibility Microsoft''s OS offers. You''ll be wanting that keyboard dock to take advantage of that, which has the unfortunate effect of jacking up the asking price.</p><p>The dock is a surprisingly good keyboard though. The keys aren''t so shallow or cramped as on the Acer Iconia W510. They offer a satisfying press, and having a full row of function keys makes it easy to adjust options like brightness and volume, features which are otherwise rather buried in Windows 8.</p><p>You will want a Bluetooth mouse though. We know that the ThinkPad trackpoint mouse has its fans, but we found it inadequate for anything but the most basic of pointing functions. It provides a very small surface area for piloting your pointer. Scooting the cursor from one side of the screen to the other takes upwards of three to four strokes. It''s fine for the occasional trip to the desktop or a non-mobile site, but anything else feels like taking a walk an inch at a time.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovothinkpad22-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 review"><figcaption>Not a bad keyboard</figcaption></figure></p><p>Then there''s the fact that the tablet doesn''t lock into place on the dock. Instead it rests snugly in a slot, which opens with the pull of a latch on the underside of the keyboard. Pairing is absolutely flawless though. Just pull a switch above the escape key and the two are talking in less than a second.</p><p>The Bluetooth connection is masterfully executed, but then if you pick up the dock or use it on your lap, there''s a good chance the tablet will fall forward. This takes really detracts from the otherwise premium feel of the ThinkPad Tablet 2.</p><p>The dock and tablet have a thin relationship. They''re a good looking couple, but don''t have much of a connection. A firm shake can separate them. For use at a desk, the dock holds the tablet at a less than perfect angle. Though the screen has excellent viewing angles, you''ll need to slouch to meet it head on.</p><p>It''s also a little harder to transport than such a light, compact device should be. When it''s docked, the ThinkPad Tablet 2 really shouldn''t be moved, lest you risk a fall. The two iems can''t fold up clamshell style like a laptop, or clip together in any way. This makes them delicate to transport, so the carrying case accessory is pretty necessary. Tack another $40 onto the price.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovothinkpad31-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 review"><figcaption>The case is nice, but jacks up the price.</figcaption></figure></p><p>At least the case Lenovo sells is handsome. It''s faux-leather with a black and red finish that matches the signature ThinkPad keyboard. It has a light magnetic seal to keep it shut, with two slots for holding the tablet and the keyboard dock, but no room for the charger. There is a thin slit on the interior for holding business cards. All in all it''s a nice case at a reasonable price, it''s just unfortunate the separate tablet and dock design necessitates it.</p><p>Getting back to the screen, videos on YouTube, Hulu and Netflix all looked good, and the lightweight processor held up just fine under the strain of streaming video. The ThinkPad Tablet 2 is definitely a nice way to watch a film while traveling. The speakers are rather lightweight, nothing you''d want to use for anything except for viral videos of cats or people falling down.</p> ', '', 'lenovothinkpad19-160-80.jpg', 'lenovothinkpad15-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'Since  a multi-headed beast, a hydra of mouse, keyboard and touch support, it''s no wonder we see', 'Since  a multi-headed beast, a hydra of mouse, keyboard and touch support, it''s no wonder we see tablets trying to be more than simple slates.

It retails for $750, half of what true transformers like the  go for, but don''t mistake the W510 for a value buy. This is  pricing without iPad performance, and for just a $100 more, you could get a more functional, albeit heavier, Windows 8 laptop. Or you could get a sleek Surface RT, preloaded with Microsoft Office. </p><p>Though the thought of a full Windows 8 slate, keyboard stand included, might be tempting, the Acer Iconia W510 is not suited to be to the solo computing option for anyone but the lightest of users. It''s meant to be someone''s second or even third device. Portability and battery life are its only true selling points, but its that unfortunate device that''s easy enough to haul, but barely functional enough to justify its presence in your bag.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>As we said, the Acer Iconia W510 is not a laptop or ultrabook, it''s a tablet. You can even buy it sans keyboard stand for $500. We wouldn''t want to though, since the stand provides extra battery life and the machine''s only full size USB port.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/acericoniaw51019-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Acer Iconia W510 review"><figcaption>A light build makes it easy to carry</figcaption></figure></p><p>On the tablet itself there''s mini-HDMI and USB, a microSD port, headphone jack, volume rocker and charging port, so it really can fly solo without the keyboard dock.</p><p>The overall design of the Iconia W510 is defined by one thing: size. At just 10.2-inches and weighing less than two pounds, it''s tiny, cute even. While this is an excellent form factor for a tablet, when you drop the W510 into its dock and start to type, you''ll feel its limitation immediately.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/acericoniaw51023-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Acer Iconia W510 review"><figcaption>Pops off the stand with the slide of a switch</figcaption></figure></p><p>In ultrabook-esque productivity mode, we found the W510''s keyboard annoying and cramped to type on. 11-inches is as small as you can go and still fit a standard laptop keyboard on your machine. Since Acer went below that form factor, some sacrifices have been made. Keys are small, shallow and the touchpad is tiny too.</p><p>Banging away on this very review, we often missed keys and always felt as though we were hunched over the thing. Overall, we found the keyboard adequate for email, but not something we''d want to do any real word processing on. Just fifteen minutes or so of composing on the Iconia W510 had us dying to get back to our  or , anything with a full, more functional keyboard.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/acericoniaw51022-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Acer Iconia W510 review"><figcaption>Home and other keys have been relagated to FN commands</figcaption></figure></p><p>The touchpad is torturous. It''s tiny and sensitive like a gnome with emotional issues. Mousing around, the arrow tended to flit all about the screen any time we applied our pointer finger with anything less than extreme precision. Unless you plan to stick with touching the screen, a wireless travel mouse is a must for the W510. Make sure its bluetooth or you''ll be giving up your only USB port to a wireless dongle.</p><p>The touchpad is not also not multi-touch capable. This means no dragging two fingers to scroll a web page or slide the Start Screen. This is a corner that really shouldn''t have been cut, since the shrunken keyboard makes Home, End, Page Up and Page Down keys into function keys. Make sure your travel mouse has a scroll wheel.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/acericoniaw51026-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Acer Iconia W510 review"><figcaption>No multi-touch here</figcaption></figure></p><p>Finally, the whole thing is unbalanced. Though the hinge is sturdy and keeps the screen in whatever position you choose, the thing tends to fall overt backwards at anything other than a ninety degree angle. The tablet/screen houses all the internals, outweighing the dock, giving it a tendency to fall over backwards when placed on anything other than a flat desktop. That''s a mighty flaw for a travel-oriented machine.</p> ', '', 'acericoniaw51004-160-80.jpg', 'acericoniaw51023-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'Don''t let the Acer Iconia W510 and its hearty hinge confuse you.

It won''t win any design awards, but the build quality seems sufficient.</p><p>The clamshell is actually a slightly different colour, and the mismatch makes it look kind of low quality, but then it is a budget machine.

While sales of tablet PCs themselves are in rude health &ndash; the  and  are doing very well, whilst small-form tablets such as the  and the  have also found success. However, while there is good news for Apple and Android devices,  tablets &ndash; especially ones running  have been far from successful. Can the Toshiba Encore succeed where others, such as the  have failed?</p><p>There are a few areas that things look good for the Toshiba Encore &ndash; at least on paper. For a start it''s one of the new breed of smaller, eight-inch Windows 8 tablets, eschewing the larger, more cumbersome, size of previous Windows 8 tablets, for something more comfortable to hold. It also comes preinstalled with , Microsoft''s update that fixed a number of problems, and addressed a number of complaints, that were levelled at Windows 8 when it first launched. It''s also important to note that the Toshiba Encore comes with Windows 8.1 and not Windows 8.1 RT. </p><p>What this means is that the Encore comes with an Intel Atom Quad Core processor, and can run legacy Windows programs (unlike Windows 8.1 RT, which can only run Windows 8 apps). This gives the tablet a bit more power, and far more flexibility, though it does mean that battery life won''t be quite as long as ARM-based tablets. The battery trade off in return for more functionality is a tricky balance that Windows 8 tablets struggle to get right &ndash; so it will be interesting to see if Toshiba has judged it correctly with the Encore.</p><p>With Sony recently announcing that it''s  of the Windows-based PC market, and Microsoft''s own  its Surface tablets, attention will surely turn to any manufacturer that can make a truly successful Windows 8 tablet. Will Toshiba strike gold with the Encore, or will it be just another noble failure that simply couldn''t compete with its iOs and Android opponents? Let''s take a look.</p><h3>Specifications</h3><p>Quite possibly the biggest draw of the Toshiba Encore is its eight-inch screen. While sometimes bigger can often mean better, seven and eight-inch tablets have been diligently carving out a healthy niche for people who want a screen that''s bigger than a phone, and yet still easy and comfortable to carry around. The size of the Toshiba Encore means that it can be held reasonably comfortably in one hand, though the large bezel around the screen, and slightly bulky depth to the machine, means it''s not quite as light as it could be. </p><p>It also means the Toshiba Encore misses out on a premium look and feel as well, and instead brings to mind the various budget Android tablets we''ve tested in the past. The 8-inch screen is decent, but with only 1280 x 800 it lacks the clarity and sharpness of a full 1080p display &ndash; and is certainly no match for the iPad''s high-resolution Retina display. Still, it does the job, displaying web pages and online video pretty well, and it also has decent viewing angles.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/toshiba-encore61160-100052699-orig-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba Encore"><figcaption>Not the highest-res screen we''ve seen</figcaption></figure></p><p>The processor in the Toshiba Encore is an Intel Atom Z3740, clocked at 1.33GHz. The latest version of Intel''s mobile Atom chips, the Z3740 is based on Intel''s new Bay Trail (http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/why-intel-s-bay-trail-is-the-next-big-thing-in-mobile-computing-1181901) 22nm architecture. These new chips are the closest Intel has come to combining power (they''re quad-core with twice the speed of previous chips, and three times the graphics power) with mobility &ndash; less heat is produced, so the device they are in can be smaller, as well has having longer battery life. </p><p>As well as being the first quad-core Atom processors Intel has produced, the integrated graphics of the Z3740 support a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1600. Pretty impressive, especially when compared to the previous generation of Atom CPUs (Clover Trail), which could only achieve 1366 x 768. This means that, at least on paper, the Toshiba Encore''s graphics performance is actually held back by the low resolution of the screen, rather than the onboard graphics &ndash; a reversal of what we see in many tablets &ndash; especially budget ones.</p><p>Alongside the processor we get 2GB of RAM, a 64GB hard drive, Bluetooth, wireless N, GPS and two webcams (one on the front, and one on the back).

It''s nearly half the weight of the Surface Pro, and considerably lighter than the Surface RT, Samsung Ativ Smart PC or iPad 4. </p><p>The Lenovo Miix offers a 10.1-inch screen, which sits in a glossy all-black front. It''s a 16:9 screen, with a resolution of 1366 x 768, meaning that in landscape orientation it looks like most computer monitors, but in portrait orientation it looks severely tall. But then, the Lenovo branding and touch-sensitive Windows button along the wider edges make it clear that it''s designed for landscape use.</p><p>The back rounds off in shimmering silver plastic that is embarrassingly aesthetically similar to Apple''s tablet, save for the speaker strip and lack of rear camera (and removable stickers - seriously, tech companies, give this up), but it looks smart enough.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovo-tablet-miix-front-detail-3-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo IdeaPad Miix review"></figure></p><p>Along the edges of the device, you have a sleep/wake key, volume controls, a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, a charging plug and a micro HDMI port. There''s also a micro USB port, but it''s positioned on the bottom edge as part of where the Lenovo Miix connects to its keyboard case, meaning that it''s useless when the tablet is in its provided case.</p><p>In terms of build quality, this tablet-laptop hybrid feels distinctly average. It doesn''t creak or shift under your fingers, but there were a couple of poorly finished edges that felt sharp under our fingers. Still, we wouldn''t worry about treating it delicately - it seems hardy enough. That goes double when you use its keyboard case.</p><p>The case for the Lenovo Miix is very plastic and corporate, which is fine, because it feels solid and durable along with it. It houses the Miix''s keyboard, which is standard Lenovo fare in looks, if a little shallower. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovo-tablet-miix-side-detail-10-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo IdeaPad Miix review"></figure></p><p>The Lenovo Miix slots in a dock on the keyboard and is held in place with clips - to use it, you open it up and the tablet is held in place by a magnet. This means that the tablet draws power from the Lenovo Miix, rather than containing extra batteries to power the tablet, like the Acer Iconia W510 does.</p><p>The case is a fine utilitarian design, and we''ll look closer at the keyboard in the Performance section of this review, but we have a couple of gripes. First, we''re annoyed that there''s no power port in the keyboard, because it''d be great to use it as a kind of docking station, rather than always having the charging cable plugged directly into the tablet. </p><p>Our second gripe is that it doesn''t hold itself closed in any way - there''s no magnet or even a physical latch to stop it flapping open. It''s a folio design, so it would be better if it closed properly.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovo-tablet-miix-folio-case-12-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo IdeaPad Miix review"></figure></p><p>Perhaps more importantly (or less, depending on your intended use), there''s no trackpad.

Firstly, looks: the Sony Xperia Tablet Z doesn''t try too hard. There are no uber fancy bells and whistles here. To all intents, it''s a simple black rectangle. But what a rectangle it is. Highly glossy glass on the front made from toughened, scratch-resistant glass.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyxperiatabletzreview07-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Tablet Z review"></figure></p><p>It looks (intentionally) like a larger version of Sony''s already stonking  phone with one minor difference - the back of the tablet isn''t glass like the phone, but a more matt-style polycarbonate makeup. And aside from the standby and power buttons on the side, there are no others. As per Google''s direction, all navigation is done via the screen''s software buttons.</p><p>Then there''s the thickness. Or, rather, the lack of. This is currently the thinnest tablet on the market - and it really shows. If you think the iPad 4 is respectable at 9.4mm (0.37 inches), then you''ll really be blown away at the Sony Xperia Tablet Z''s 6.9mm (0.27 inches).</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyxperiatabletzreview15-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Tablet Z review"></figure></p><p>In terms of overall footprint, it''s slightly different, clocking in at 266mm x 172mm (10.5 x 6.8 inches) compared to the Apple offering''s 241.2mm x 185.7mm (9.5 x 7.3 inches). But the other thing you''ll notice is just how light it is.</p><p>Weight is one of the tricky ones, with frequent complaints that tablets such as the iPad become too heavy to hold for long periods of time. The iPad 4 tips the scales at 662g (1.46lbs) and even the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is no feather at 600g (1.32lbs). The Sony Xperia Tablet Z trumps them both at 495g (1.09lbs). </p><p>This really is one of those devices you have to experience to appreciate. Pictures and YouTube videos just don''t do it justice.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyxperiatabletzreview14-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Tablet Z review"></figure></p><p>Added to that is the fact that the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, like the Sony Xperia Z phone, is water and dust resistant. </p><p>This is a tablet you can comfortably take into the bath and not worry about. It''s slightly disconcerting doing so, since every fibre of your being is telling you not to dunk it in the water, but provided you make sure the waterproof plugs are in the sockets, you''ll be fine.</p><p>In fact, the only way this doesn''t work is when trying to swipe underwater. The screen registers all kinds of movements, so you have to take it out and dry the screen to really get it to register screen taps. Mind you, if you''re likely to be playing Fruit Ninja underwater, you probably need to have a word with a doctor. For watching movies in the bath or at the bus stop in the rain, you''ll be fine.</p><p>If you try and run water on the display, get ready for a panic, as it registers a million taps and opens every app under the sun, making you worry that the tablet has a plug open and water is getting inside. It''s not, stay cool.</p><p>However, we do wonder if waterproofing this tablet is anything more than a gimmick. Yes, you can use it in the bath without worrying, or get egg on it while cooking. It makes it feel more rugged, indeed.</p><p>But do you need a tablet to do that? Without the covers it might feel like a more slick product, and that''s something we would love to see. It could possibly do away with the angular corners too, which is a real design problem in our eyes.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyxperiatabletzreview17-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Tablet Z review"></figure></p><p>We''re not totally sold on the dust resistance either. Yes, it means that dust won''t get in beneath the screen, which used to be one of our main bugbears on devices of old. But the Sony Xperia Tablet Z does have a ridge all the way around the edge that seems to attract lint. You can clear it with a blow or a blast from a vacuum but it''ll just come back. And don''t get us started on fingerprints - this is a magnet for them.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sony20xperia20tablet20z2010-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Tablet Z review"></figure></p><p>And the screen is another area you''ll want to know about. We weren''t bowled over by the displays on more recent devices such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 or  because of their resolutions. </p><p>The trouble is once you''ve experienced a sharpness like Apple''s Retina displays, nothing else can really live up to your expectations. We used an  recently and it felt almost third world that we were able to spot pixels on websites and ebooks, even if it was less of an issue with photos and videos. The same could be said of Sony''s Xperia Tablet S. </p><p>But there are no such issues here. The Sony Xperia Tablet Z sports a Full HD display - 1200 x 1920 pixels spread over its 10.1-inch screen, giving a pixel density of 224ppi. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyxperiatabletzreview08-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Tablet Z review"></figure></p><p>It''s not the sharpest out there - that honour is held by the  and its staggering 299ppi for the larger tablet and 323ppi on the  - but even still the Sony Xperia Tablet Z excels with it''s clever screen processing technology. </p><p>We spot pixels for fun and can categorically say that this is a super sharp display that we were more than impressed with. And surprisingly in side by side comparisons, it bested the Google Nexus 10 and was every inch the equal of the iPad 4 - beating the latter when it comes to movie watching simply because it has a more widescreen ratio.</p><p>On top of that, Sony''s equipped the Xperia Tablet Z with its Mobile Bravia Engine. A lot of the time this is all smoke and mirrors, using fancy new titles that add little to the experience. Not so much here, though. The Sony Xperia Tablet Z looks absolutely phenomenal, with photos and videos popping out of the screen brilliantly. </p><p>Even on just normal tasks, like web browsing, the colour is spot-on. It''s not too bland but also not overly colourful, which is a criticism sometimes levelled at Samsung. Whites look warm on the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, rather than yellow. </p><p>There is little here we can criticise, other than the fact that the screen is sometimes too bright. We had the Sony Xperia Tablet Z set to auto-brightness, but found ourselves often having to manually turn it right down to the lowest possible setting. Maybe Sony thinks we''re all half blind, but sometimes less is more. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyxperiatabletzreview02-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Tablet Z review"></figure></p><p>One other observation we must point out here is how much better the screen viewing angles are on the Sony Xperia Tablet Z compared to the smartphone equivalent. On the tablet, it''s an LED-backlit LCD panel, while the Xperia Z phone ships with a TFT display. </p><p>The phone screen is sharp and bright, but look at it anything other than dead-on and it looks more washed out than an old pair of jeans. You won''t find this on the Tablet Z, where the viewing angles are much better, although the iPad does have a superior contrast ratio based on general usage. </p><p>It''s good to see, since this could have been a massive Achilles'' heel, especially because you''d be more likely to share content with friends on a larger screen, watching movies together and so on.</p><p>If you''re a fan of movies, a microSD card slot is another big bonus here. Sony has stuck two fingers up at Google and its move to cloud-based alternatives, forcing people into 32GB or less of onboard storage. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sony20xperia20tablet20z208-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Tablet Z review"></figure></p><p>It means that you can buy a 16GB model and easily bump your storage up by an extra 64GB without breaking the bank. It''s a big issue. Google assumes people are happy to stream from the cloud, but bearing in mind the space an OS and bloatware can take up and the fact that you have to install apps onto the internal memory, by the time you''ve added a few big ones like the GTA games, a couple of HD movies and a few songs, your allowance is shot. </p><p>And if you''re on a plane or a train and want to stream from your collection of 30,000 tunes, you''re out of luck unless you''ve previously decided which ones to download to the device. That''s why we remain fans of SD card slots, even if you disagree in some of the comments sections.</p><p>Powering this beast - and making sure your movies all play without lag or stutter - is a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor with a quad-core 1.5GHz Krait CPU. Add to that 2GB RAM and you''re on fire. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/sonyxperiatabletzreview06-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Tablet Z review"></figure></p><p>Some early reports have claimed there is a slight lag on certain tasks such as swiping from screen to screen, though the same posters have added that installing another launcher such as Nova or Apex fixes the issue. </p><p>We didn''t notice much lag on our unit, and we really rinsed the Sony Xperia Tablet Z as much as we could. Occasionally it would take a couple of taps of the home button to go back to the main screen, but it wasn''t often and it tended to be during CPU-intensive tasks. Either way, if those reports are true for some, it''s to do with Sony''s launcher rather than a hardware issue, so Sony will be able to fix this with an update.</p><p>We did notice that the screen isn''t as responsive as we''d have liked. When browsing the web in portrait mode it bounced all over the place at times, and we want something amazing - really amazing - in a tablet that costs this much,</p><p>Powering the Sony Xperia Tablet Z you''ll find a 6,000mAh power pack. While huge, it''s not the biggest out there, bearing in mind the iPad 4''s is nearly double the size at 11,560mAh and the Galaxy Note 10.1 offers up 7,000mAh. We''ll go into how it performed in the Battery section of our review.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/xperiatabletz-press-01-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Sony Xperia Tablet Z review"></figure></p><p>Charging is done via a micro USB connection, which means you can use any other chargers you have lying around the house too, though you have to have a wall socket, since it won''t charge off a laptop. Hard luck. </p><p>We won''t lie, the act of charging is a pain. For one thing, you have to take the waterproof cover out each time (this is the downside of having a waterproof tablet) - unless you''re using the pricey official dock with charging contacts - and although high quality and secure, we can''t help but wonder how long they will last. </p><p>Add to that, this is not a quick charging device. Where you can plug an iPad in for a 10 minute power blast and be confident you''ll gain a bit of juice for a quick jaunt, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z takes forever to charge up. We found it''s definitely an all-night job.

However, it''s relatively pricey and comes with a too-loud fan, poor speakers and a dim screen. We''d expect better from a tablet this expensive.', '', ' <p>The WT310 is Toshiba''s answer to the , but to even try and compare the two devices would be foolish. </p><p>Where the Surface Pro is the definition of utilitarian efficiency, with its fixed specs and clean-cut magnesium body, the WT310 has been designed from the start to be one of the most flexible Windows 8 Pro tablets you can buy. </p><p>Designed for the business and education market, the WT310 can be customised with any conceivable form of storage - including the Intel i5 Haswell series - which makes it a very serious competitor not only to the Surface Pro, but also to many of the premium Windows 8 tablets out there. </p><p>But simply offering a specs list is rarely enough and many Windows 8 tablets in the past have followed a trend of being either underpowered or overpowered and impractical to carry. In some respects the WT310 addresses these concerns, but in others it becomes a frustratingly old story. </p><p>Let''s get one thing out of the way right now: the WT310 is no looker. The utilitarian aspirations of the product are expressed in a thoroughly undecorative exterior. The WT30 looks about as interesting as a doorstop. </p><p>The tablet is almost entirely made from plastic, and weighs in at 825g - and while that makes it lighter than the Surface Pro, we would have accepted the weight gain for an increase in build quality. </p><p>While it''s clearly been built to withstand the daily commute, it makes for an unpleasant holding experience, with the back plate flexing inwards to an alarming degree. </p><p>Large vented ports on the top, side and bottom help pump air around, keeping that state-of-the-art fourth generation Intel i5 processor cool. </p><p>The home button is large and easily accessible, and while it doesn''t feel great, it certainly looks like it''ll last. </p><h3>Plenty of power </h3><p>We tested the WT310-108, which is the highest specced version and comes with Windows 8 Pro 64-bit. With a 3MP camera on the back and a 1MP camera on the front, this is surprisingly low, considering the competition and in use it really shows. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/win11.desirerev3.toshibab-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba WT310"></figure></p><p>Underneath the plastic shell, there''s an extremely capable i5 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD, putting it on a par with not only the Surface Pro but also some of the better Ultrabooks out there (as well as the Apple MacBook Air). Of course, what''s important to remember is that these specs come at a price, making the WT310-108 a serious investment. </p><p>Adorning the front there''s a 11.6-inch Full-HD LED display. Colours are impressively recreated with extremely dark blacks, but what it boasts in fidelity it lacks in brightness, making it extremely difficult to use in sunlight. </p><p>News isn''t any rosier when it comes to audio either. Despite having two speakers on the bottom, the WT310 sounds awful, with extremely low volume levels. It''s as if more of the sound is directed into the device, causing a tinny distortion to occur when they''re pushed even slightly.</p><p> In truth, the WT310 hasn''t been created as the ultimate entertainment centre. Instead, it''s intended as a truly portable office solution, and it certainly ticks many of the boxes. </p><p>Pen support is present, but a built-in holder will cost you extra. Windows 8 Pro means you''ll be able to run full versions of Office without it breaking a sweat, and the AppUp storefront gives you a choice of apps optimised for the processor. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/win11.desirerev3.toshibac-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba WT310"></figure></p><p>Connectivity is also excellent, with a mini HDMI, USB 3.0, SD Card and Bluetooth 4.0 all present and correct. One thing to note is the sound of the fan: even when performing apparently low-level tasks, the WT310 is by no means a quiet tablet. Place it somewhere between an Xbox 360 and a MacBook Air in terms of noise. </p><h3>Verdict</h3><p>We''ve focused a lot on the WT310''s negatives, but we can see it being a faithful companion to any travelling businessman or woman. The impressive specs sheet and a sturdy - but uninspiring - shell mean it should certainly last. </p><p>But why pay this much money for what appears to be increased portability, only to find yourself with a loud fan, poor sound and a dim screen that will be hard to see in many locations? The WT310 can do a lot of what you need, but at this price, we expect something you can really love.</p> ', '', 'win11.desirerev3.toshibaa-160-80.jpg', 'win11.desirerev3.toshibab-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'The WT310 is Toshiba''s answer to the , but to even try and compare the two devices would be', 'The WT310 is Toshiba''s answer to the , but to even try and compare the two devices would be foolish.

It''s particularly good for mobile working when you only need to check and write emails or give a quick presentation. The battery ', '', ' <p>The Dell Latitude 10 is an Intel Atom powered tablet that''s designed as a robust device that can be used both with a keyboard and mouse (there''s a USB port on the side) or as a standard slate tablet.</p><p> It runs full-blown , unlike Microsoft''s , which runs the cut-down  that can''t run full desktop apps. The Latitude 10, however, is completely happy with most desktop apps, but it''s hardly a powerhouse, with a dual-core 1.8GHz Atom under the hood. </p><p>Performance is fine for basic use, such as sending mails and flicking through tweets, and the 2GB of memory is a sign that this isn''t a device intended for powerhouse computing. Speed is also helped by the use of a SSD drive, though this means that storage space is compromised - it''s strictly in the tablet territory. </p><p>However, more intensive desktop work can be a trifle slow. And that''s a shame, because the Latitude 10 is worth the &pound;450/$530 that the basic 32GB model costs - in relation to many tablets, especially other Intel Atom-based Windows 8 devices such as the , although that does come with 64GB of storage and a detachable keyboard as standard. </p><h3>Storage woes </h3><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/win10.desirerev3.delllatitudeflat-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Latitude 10"></figure></p><p>Storage is one of the big challenges with Windows 8 tablets and the 32GB provided with the entry-level Latitude 10 doesn''t provide a huge amount of headroom over and above a full Windows 8 install and you''ll quickly find that your drive has filled up. A full PC replacement this definitely isn''t. </p><p>And while Windows 8-style apps are usually pretty lean in terms of size, once you''ve downloaded a few of them, you''ll soon find yourself running out of room to store them all. However, a 64 GB version is available, which also features a swappable battery (it''s this version Dell sent us for review). </p><p>The standard battery is a two cell 3,880mAh version, while there''s a whopping 7,760mAh four-cell version you can choose. The swappable battery could be really useful, although you might not need it - even when stressed we got around seven to eight hours from the standard battery, while on idle you can expect it to last well into the teens in terms of hours. This is where the lower power Atom processor has a distinct benefit. </p><p>As you might have guessed from the name, the Latitude 10 boasts a 10.1-inch display. It has a reasonable resolution at 1,366 x 768, though if you''ve used one you''ll really notice the difference compared to a retina display iPad, for example. It''s certainly great for use with Windows 8 apps and you can swipe between things easily. </p><h3>Business focused </h3><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/win10.desirerev3.delllatitudeback-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Dell Latitude 10"></figure></p><p>The Latitude 10 is a trifle lighter than the iPad at 648g and, as such, feels like a really pleasant device to use in the hand, with a smooth, tactile finish that won''t fingerprint like many glossy finishes. You can have any colour, as long as it''s black. </p><p>A dock is also available for the Latitude 10 that offers a really solid charging stand for your tablet as well as Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI and extra USB ports. A soft case is also available for it, too. </p><p>The dock hints at the business-orientated use for this device - Latitude is Dell''s business mobile computing brand, after all. The business connection isn''t just in terms of the name and robust appearance. The 64GB model boasts a TPM (Trusted Platform Module), which is a business-orientated feature designed to prevent unauthorised changes to the operating system. </p><h3>Verdict</h3><p>So can we recommend the Latitude 10? Yes, but with one key caveat - it is not a laptop replacement if you do intensive tasks of any sort. A workhorse PC it is not. We certainly wouldn''t recommend its use on a desk as a PC replacement, but it is handy as a second desk screen for keeping an eye on social feeds or email. And it''s handy in meetings, too. </p><p>But what it is great for is keeping in touch when you''re out of the office, when you only need to check and write emails or give a quick presentation. The battery life is simply stunning. </p><p>But when buying a tablet at this price point, there are still better options out there, such as the Microsoft . It''s a full-blown Windows 8 tablet, too (albeit with Windows 8 Pro) but it features a Core i5 processor instead. That means it really is capable of being your main display (it does still only come with 32GB of storage, however).

While you''d struggle to pick an Amazon Kindle Fire HD from a lineup of budget tablets, here we have a device that sports a couple of key visual flourishes.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/press20nook20hd20magazine-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nook HD+ review"></figure></p><p>Chief among these is the large hole-grip situated on the bottom left-hand corner of the tablet (in portrait view). It might be there to hook a lanyard through, but it also serves as a handy thumb-grip when handling the device, enabling you to get real purchase on it with a single hand.</p><p>Yes, unlike the iPad, this is a full-fat tablet that''s light enough to hold in one hand - at least for brief periods. At just 510g (18oz), the Nook HD+ is almost 140g (5oz) lighter than the iPad 4. That''s roughly the weight of an  shorn from its body.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nook20hd20hole-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nook HD+ review"></figure></p><p>This has been achieved, inevitably, through the heavy (or should that be light?) use of plastics, though that''s not to say the Nook HD+ feels especially cheap. It''s no  on the premium components scale, but it feels fairly firm in the hand.</p><p>We did get some disconcerting flexing and creaking when we applied a little two-handed pressure, but in general usage it''s a reasonably solid construction.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nook20hd20thickness-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nook HD+ review"></figure></p><p>One slight negative from an aesthetic point of view is that typical bulging Nook bezel, which provides a raised ridge around the screen. With the aforementioned corner grip sitting flush with the screen, it makes the Nook HD+ look a little like a skinnier tablet that''s been slid into some kind of protective bumper.</p><p>Still, the thick border aids handling, and will doubtless provide protection should you put the device down screen-first when in a hurry (shame on you).</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/press20nook20hd20cover-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nook HD+ review"></figure></p><p>Around the back, the Nook HD+ has a pleasingly tactile matt finish that reminds us of the Kindle Fire HD range. Curiously, there''s only one speaker grille here compared to the dual setup of the smaller Nook HD.</p><p>In terms of hardware buttons, the Nook HD+ benefits from a physical home key on the front, although the tiny n-shape doesn''t feel as reassuringly clicky as Apple''s iPad equivalent. But then, it only has two simple functions to fulfill - to wake the device up and to return you to the home screen.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nook20hd20back-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nook HD+ review"></figure></p><p>The other physical keys are even more vague, with the power button situated at the top of the right-hand side (again when held in portrait view), and the volume rocker just around the corner on the top edge, with a 3.5mm jack alongside.</p><p>These hardware keys are small and non-descript, and it takes a while until you can reliably hit them without having to look or feel around the edges.</p><p>One component that definitely punches above the Nook HD+''s weight is its 9-inch display. With a resolution of 1920 x 1280, it''s virtually as sharp as the latest iPad''s Retina display, and it''s also remarkably clear.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nook20hd20buttons-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nook HD+ review"></figure></p><p>If you''re used to the colder, bluish tinge of the iPad, you might find the tone of the display a little yellowish, but it makes for an easier text-reading experience (Nooks are, after all, ebook readers above all else) and isn''t as pronounced as, say, the .</p><p>Finally, along the bottom of the device we have a proprietary 30-pin port rather than a universal micro USB port.

This means that you can easily hook up the Hudl to your TV - a feature that Tesco clearly included in order to push its Blinkbox service into your living room.

There isn''t even a front-facing camera, so no Skype chatting on this device. </p><p>Amazon has updated the design of the 7-inch variant to bring it in line with the HDX range and its rivals in terms of build quality.

It''s quietly pleasing from a tactile perspective, even though it lacks the sheer machined precision and premium feel of Apple''s tablets.</p><p>While Apple has opted for a super-slim bezel for its iPad mini - partly to facilitate that wider 7.9-inch display - Amazon has been more generous with its own offerings.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kindlefirehd-handson-02-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HD review"></figure></p><p>Indeed, the fairly thick border around even the smaller 7-inch screen brings it closer to the full-sized iPad in design than its miniature brother.</p><p>I like this approach from a purely practical perspective (although it makes it look a little chubby, if I''m honest). It''s still comfier to hold the seven-inch model between your thumb and fingers than it is to rest it in the span of your hand, even when held in portrait view.</p><p>Of course, that''s partly because it''s slightly chunky for its size - at 345g the 7-inch model is just 14g heavier than the iPad mini.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kindlefirehd-handson-12-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HD"><figcaption>Comfy to hold, even if it is a little chunky</figcaption></figure></p><p>The display on the Kindle Fire HD packs a decent resolution of 1280 x 800 with a ppi of 216.

In an unusual move, Toshiba has crammed the components behind the screen, along with the W30t''s primary battery &ndash; the base only houses the keyboard, some ports and a secondary power pack.

It''s the W30t-A-100, and it shares its screen and chassis with the system we''ve reviewed here. The big difference comes under the hood, where Toshiba has fitted AMD hardware. The A4-1200 is a modest mobile processor with two cores clocked to 1GHz, and it''s got Radeon HD 8180 graphics. </p><p> While that''s enough to run Windows, it won''t be able to match the Haswell hardware inside our review sample in either applications or games &ndash; but, on the plus side, its price is significantly cheaper.</p><h3> Specifications</h3><p> It''s vital for any type of laptop to have a good screen, which is why Toshiba has installed an IPS panel inside the W30t. That''s usually a guarantee of quality &ndash; almost all top laptops include this type of panel &ndash; but elsewhere the Toshiba''s panel gives away the W30t''s mid-range status. Its 1,366 x 768 resolution, for instance, matches the resolution of the Lenovo Yoga 11S and the Asus Transformer Book T100, but it can''t compete with the pixels offered by the Full HD panels on the Sony VAIO Duo 13 and the Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/hestiafanless05front-leftjul1341with-screen-content-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba Satellite W30t-A-101"><figcaption>The screen is an IPS unit</figcaption></figure></p><p> Power is provided by Intel''s Core i3-4020Y. It''s designated as a mid-range chip, and it uses the latest Haswell architecture, but the ''Y'' suffix is important &ndash; it means this is an ultra-low-power part. That means a modest clock speed of 1.5GHz, no Turbo Boost, and only two Hyper-Threaded cores.</p><p> The integrated graphics chip has been cut back, too: rather than the HD Graphics 4600 GPU included on full-fat Haswell chips, the Toshiba''s processor has HD Graphics 4200. Both cores have 20 stream processors, but the difference comes in clock speeds &ndash; HD Graphics 4600 hits a maximum of 1,350MHz, depending on the processor, but HD Graphics 4200 is reined in to 850MHz. </p><p> It''s not all bad news, though: this ultra-low-power part has a TDP of just 11.5W, which is the lowest of any Haswell chip &ndash; and should help ensure lengthy battery life.</p><h3>Storage space</h3><p> The rest of the specification matches up with our mid-range expectations, with 4GB of RAM and a 500GB hard disk. The latter component provides plenty of space, but other machines have more impressive storage: every other machine we''ve mentioned in this review has an SSD.</p><p> The Toshiba''s Intel-made wireless chip is dual-band, and there''s Bluetooth 4.0, but there''s no Gigabit Ethernet on-board or in an adapter. The port selection is found wanting elsewhere, too; there''s only one USB 3 port, on the base. Elsewhere, there''s a micro-USB port, microSD card slot, micro-HDMI connector and a headphone jack.</p><p> It''s all wrapped up inside a chassis that''s finished with silver brushed aluminium and black plastic and, while the Toshiba looks good, it doesn''t quite have the impact of the super-slim Sony VAIO Duo 13 or the bright orange Lenovo Yoga 11S. </p><p> Part of that''s because the Toshiba isn''t quite as smart, but part of it comes down to the dimensions: the Satellite is 25mm thick and weighs 2.1kg.

The HD 7 is very similar in size, being just a smidge wider and thicker, but gains back the advantage by forcing you to carry a little less heft at just 302g, compared to the 340g of the Nexus 7.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p1-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="MeMo Pad colours"></figure></p><p>This reduction in weight is despite that minor increase in overall size, with dimensions of 196.8 x 120.6 x 10.8mm.</p><p>The similarities don''t end there, as the HD 7 offers a 7-inch screen at the same 1280 x 800 resolution as the original Nexus 7, and also arrives with a quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM.</p><p>Despite having similar specifications on paper, the processor is significantly different to the Tegra 3 in the original Nexus 7. It is a MediaTek MTK8125 which is very similar to the MTK6589 that can be found in many Chinese market phones, but it doesn''t contain cellular radios. Indeed, there is no cellular version of the HD 7.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="On screen"></figure></p><p>This is a very interesting choice of system from Asus, something it has a history of doing. MediaTek designs its processors to be inexpensive but with good performance and good battery life, and the MTK8125 here is no different: it contains four ARM Cortex A7 cores. </p><p>Unlike many other budget tablets, Asus hasn''t skimped on the screen. It has the same resolution as the original Nexus 7, which offers a high 216ppi density, comfortably beating the  and the Samsung  - but it falls down when compared to the 2013  and . </p><p>This bears out in use, with a nice sharp screen that''s bright and clear. It''s perhaps not quite as good as the best in the business, but it''s a step up on the previous Asus offering with this size screen, the .</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/p3-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Held by fingers"></figure></p><p>Being an IPS LCD screen, it has fantastic viewing angles. It does suffer from a little more glare than we would like and the colour balance seems a little favoured towards a yellowish tint, but these are minor complaints.</p><p>The only real negative is the lack of auto-brightness control, but leaving the brightness at a middle setting is good enough most of the time.</p><p>If you have used the original Nexus 7, then holding this latest Asus offering is initially going to feel quite familiar. But after a few moments, some differences become clear, the first of which isn''t positive.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/h1-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Outdoor lifestyle shot"></figure></p><p>As your fingers run over the back of the tablet, you may feel as I did that the glossy plastics are not of the highest quality, managing to achieve a slightly slimy feel and offering no grip.</p><p>To avoid the tablet slipping from my hands I grabbed it by the sides, and in one hand it is just ever so slightly too wide to be comfortable. The original Nexus 7 also had this flaw and the tiny increase in girth here does nothing to help.</p><p>Neither does the noticeable seam between the coloured back and the glossy black chamfered edge which gives the impression of a cheap third-party case. It''s certainly not the worst compromise Asus could have made, but the tablet is clearly designed this way to achieve its low price point.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/h3-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Rear shot"></figure></p><p>Holding the HD 7 with one hand between thumb and forefingers is a comfortable grip that can be maintained for some time, no doubt due to its relative lightness and weight balance. Spread your fingers out over the back and the neatly etched Asus logo becomes obvious.</p><p>The 5MP rear camera is housed in a small bulge, but thankfully the lens is recessed slightly as the tablet rests on the moulded plastic. When using the HD 7 on a flat surface, its curved back can cause the tablet to rock slightly against that bulge.</p><p>There is no camera flash. It would be a neater and cleaner design if Asus had been able to make the camera housing flush, as it has on the new Nexus 7.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/h4-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Side buttons"></figure></p><p>Above the screen on the front is where Asus has housed the 1.2MP front facing camera. It is very visible but at least it''s centred, unlike on some other Asus devices including the new Nexus 7. Putting an item like that off-centre does nothing for my OCD.</p><p>On the left side of the device are the rather excellent buttons, with the one piece volume key sited just below the power button. They don''t have a very responsive feel but they''re easy to find with your fingertips. The buttons are coloured to match the finish of the rest of the rear, blending in nicely.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/h5-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Ports"></figure></p><p>Unusually, the HD 7 has its micro-USB port located on the top of the device next to the standard 3.5mm headphone jack, with the microphone hole sited between these two ports. While it''s uncommon to find the USB port on the top of a tablet of this size, it is ergonomically sound as the HD 7 is simple to use while charging. </p><p>The positioning of this port also helps reduce the costs of manufacturing the tablet, as the circuit board has the connection for the port at the top. Asus has avoided running a cable to the bottom of the tablet as it had to on the original Nexus 7.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/h10-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Side view slot"></figure></p><p>The HD 7 has 16GB of internal storage, although only around 12GB is available initially. Expandable storage is provided through a microSD card slot on the left side of the tablet and is simply open to the world - I fear it could become filled with dust and dirt.</p><p>The card clicks in and is simple to remove, while being held in securely at the same time. Asus also provides 16GB of cloud storage for one year.</p><p>Asus has managed to include stereo speakers in the HD 7 despite there being just a single speaker grill. The two physical units are housed behind it and provide some satisfyingly loud output. They do distort quite heavily at high volumes, which is no surprise given just how loud they go.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/h6-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Speakers"></figure></p><p>The final piece of the puzzle in the make-up of the HD 7 is the battery. It''s the same basic capacity as in the new Nexus 7 at 15Wh. Asus quotes 10 hours of battery life, which seems a bit optimistic but not entirely unrealistic.</p><p>The tablet sips power during extended sleep periods and has a fairly efficient chipset, but the overall battery life falls short of the original Nexus 7, not to mention the iPad mini.</p><p>It is however fairly rapid to charge despite the power plug adapter provided in the box not having as high an output as some that are provided with tablets.</p> ', '', 'p2-160-80.jpg', 'p2-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'By partnering with Google and introducing the world to the original Nexus 7, Asus became a', 'By partnering with Google and introducing the world to the original Nexus 7, Asus became a de-facto leader in the small form factor tablet market.

There are no special design flares and it''s a relatively unmistakable black slab in comparison to more premium affairs from Apple and Samsung.</p><p>One thing that Asus could take notice of for their next Nexus tablet, however, are the stereo front-facing speakers driven by Nvidia PureAudio. In landscape mode they''re positioned either side of the screen in a configuration most similar to HTC''s award-winning  smartphone.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/tegranote-handson-01-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Advent Tegra Note 7 review"><figcaption>A touch on the heavy side, but not too weighty</figcaption></figure></p><p>They''re not bad speakers either, and though they''re not going to give you cinema-rivalling performance, they''re clear enough to make watching YouTube clips far more enjoyable than the mono or rear-positioned speakers that so many other manufacturers seem comfortable with. To the left (in landscape) there''s a front-facing camera with VGA resolution and an auto-brightness sensor.</p><p>The Tegra Note 7 takes design cues from the original Nexus 7 on the rear of the tablet, with the middle portion given a tactile feel thanks to dimpled finish. In the centre there''s the embossed Tegra Note logo, while above and below this band of rubber you''ll find the relatively understated Advent Vega branding. </p><p>Also on the rear you''ll find a 5MP camera, that unfortunately omits any form of flash, and is positioned rather too close to the power button for my liking. This positioning means you''ll often end up applying smudges to the camera when fumbling for the power button, which of course can inhibit camera performance.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/tegranote-handson-05-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Advent Tegra Note 7 review"><figcaption>Micro-USB, micro-HDMI, headphones, power button</figcaption></figure></p><p>Connectivity mostly resides on the left or top edge of the tablet, depending which way you hold it, with a micro-USB port for charging, a micro-HDMI port for HD video output and a 3.5mm jack for audio.

It''s worth mentioning at this point that when Nvidia updated the Tegra Note 7 to Android 4.3, it also furthered the flexibility of the micro-SD card support, by allowing apps to be installed to the SD.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/tegranote-handson-04-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Advent Tegra Note 7 review"><figcaption>Micro-SD slot and volume control</figcaption></figure></p><p>Finally the right/bottom edge is where you''ll find the stylus residing, but more on this later.

It''s slim and lightweight at just 13.2 ounces, and the display is an 8.9-inch, 2560 x 1600 resolution screen. That gives you 339 PPI in what Amazon says is 100% sRGB color accurate.</p><div class="vams_video" data-vams-id="sGRr9fI2Y401z"></div><p>The display makes photos, videos and gaming a real pleasure. This is even made sweeter by the fact that you''ll have access to so many TV shows and movies if you''re an Amazon Prime member.</p><p>Speaking of Amazon Prime, you''ve gotta be careful with your impulsiveness with this tablet, as it''s so easy to get carried away and shop for everything you don''t need.</p><p>Amazon''s tablet features Fire OS 3.0, which is based on Android, though you won''t find Android mentioned on the box or on much literature. </p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kindle-hdx-review-35-580-100.jpg" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 review"></p><p>You also won''t find the Google Play Store here, either.

For its size, we expected to be a little heftier, but we''re glad that''s not the case. It makes holding the device for extended periods of time, like when you''re watching a movie, pretty easy.</p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kindle-hdx-review-13-580-100.jpg" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 review"></p><p>Around the edges are contours and bevels that make the tablet feel even slimmer than it is, and it also gives a nice look to the device. It definitely helps make it stand out from other flat slabs out there. </p><p>As mentioned before, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 has a 2560 x 1600 display with 339 PPI and 100% sRGB color accuracy. If that all sounds fancy to you, it''s because it is, but all you need to know is that the display is sharp, colorful and has good contrast. We like it.</p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kindle-hdx-review-47-580-100.jpg" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 review"></p><p>There is a front-facing 720p HD camera, and an 8MP rear camera with an f/2.2 aperture and electronic image stabilization. You can also record 1080p HD videos with the rear camera, but for courtesy''s sake, we rarely ever recommend anyone use the camera to shoot photos or video.</p><p>The backside has two speakers up top, which aren''t as loud as we''d like, but they sound very clear and actually offers good stereo sound. The rear camera is in the top middle along with an LED flash. On one side you have volume controls on the bezel, and opposite that is the power button.

The left edge of the device, if you''re looking directly at the display, has a micro-USB port for charging and syncing, and the opposite edge has a 3.5mm headset jack.</p><p>Overall, the in-hand feel and weight of the device gives it a very premium feel. Compared to other Android offerings out there, though this isn''t truly an Android tablet, it''s one of the best built tablets. </p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kindle-hdx-review-20-580-100.jpg" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 review"></p><p>We can''t stress enough the light weight of the device, which really helps in portability and sustained holding/viewing. </p><p>Placement of the micro-USB and 3.5mm headset jacks are nicely done, as they''re mostly out of the way if you have to have either plugged in while watching videos. The only improvement would''ve been to place the headset jack on the bottom so that it''s completely out of the way when viewing the screen, but that''s a minor gripe.</p><p>The speakers are also nicely placed because they are completely out of the way of your hands when you''re holding the tablet to watch videos. This helps because they''re not the loudest speakers, so being free from any obstruction is a huge help. </p><p>Amazon has improved on the Kindle Fire''s design tremendously since the first version, which in itself wasn''t all that bad. The soft touch edges and back, the contours and placement of ports, buttons and more is nicely executed. </p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kindle-hdx-review-93-580-100.jpg" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 review"></p><p>You can really tell a nicely designed device when things are there when you need them, and out of the way when you don''t.

The glass display and body give it a halfway decent feel.</p><p>At the bottom end, where the tablet is curved for the kickstand, there is the power button and headset jack opposite each other. The power button is actually really nice, and has a good feel to it when pressed. It may be odd to mention this, but when compared to other tablets, it seems really cushy.</p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovo-yoga-review-103-580-100.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 review"></p><p>The opposite side of the power button is the 3.5mm headset jack, and above that is the volume button and a small microphone. </p><p>When the device is facing you in landscape orientation, you''ll also notice there are two front-facing speakers. If you purchase the tablet, you will have already noticed the Dolby logo on the box. </p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovo-yoga-review-107-580-100.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 review"></p><p>The speakers will offer Dolby Digital Plus enhancement, which should mean that its sound would be superior to what you''d normally find on tablets. We''ll get more into that later. </p><p>Flip the tablet over to reveal its backside, and you''ll see a nicely textured back with a smooth panel at the bottom where the kickstand flips out.</p><p>Open up that kickstand and you''ll reveal the microSD card slot. The Yoga Tablet 10 will support up to 64GB microSD cards, so if you have tons of media and documents you need to take around with you, we''re sure you''ll find plenty of storage options here.</p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovo-yoga-review-45-580-100.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 review"></p><p>By default, you''ll have either 16GB or 32GB memory options. You''ll also get 1GB RAM, which doesn''t sound like a lot compared to modern flagship tablets and even smartphones, but it''ll be plenty for social network, watching videos and maybe a few lightweight games here and there.</p><p>Like most tablets these days, the Yoga Tablet 10 also has front and rear-facing cameras. We really wish this trend would die in tablets, except the front-facing camera for video calling, but it''s here. </p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovo-yoga-review-34-580-100.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 review"></p><p>The front-facing camera is a 1.6MP HD camera, which you can use for taking selfies or making video calls. The rear camera, which should never really be used for taking stills, is a 5MP shooter. </p><p>Interestingly, not long after pulling the tablet out of the box, we noticed a gash behind the flap or kickstand. We''re not exactly sure what would''ve caused this, but it''s worth noting that the metal kickstand, which is the only metallic part of this whole tablet, may be very soft, so we would be careful to take care of it.</p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovo-yoga-review-54-580-100.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 review"></p><p>Overall, we''re satisfied with the hardware and build quality of the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10. Initially, we had mixed feelings about the design and the rounded edge, but after a while we used it more to grip and carry the device. Having the kickstand hinge is worth the unusual design choice.</p><h3>Software</h3><p>The Yoga Tablet 10 runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, so you aren''t going to find the latest and greatest here. However, it will support most Android apps, and for what you might use a tablet, we don''t expect any real shortcomings because of this Android version.</p><p><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovo-yoga-review-68-580-100.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 review"></p><p>If you''re already familiar with Android, you''ll feel right at home once you power on the Yoga Tablet 10.

All in all, it''s turned into a pretty meaty bit of gaming kit. Basically, it was much more than a glorified Flick Golf player.</p><p>Which is why it''s time Nvidia re-hyped the Shield initiative.

The reason? Nvidia thinks it can offer us the best of both worlds: a decent tablet and a hardcore gaming device for when we fancy jumping from Real Racing 3 to Titanfall. It wanted to create the world''s first console-grade tablet, and it''s fair to say that (so far) it''s succeeded on that front.</p><p>And now that the guts have been given an upgrade, Nvidia''s Shield tablet is a device truly built to handle Android gaming, Steam streaming, or playing one of over 120 Gamestream-ready PC titles that are ready from the off. In fact, this is the world''s first Gamestream tablet, which is reason alone to be intrigued.</p><p>Perhaps even more pleasing is the price: at $299/&pound;239 (around AU$320) for the 16GB, WiFi-only model, and $399/&pound;299 (around AU$425) for the 32GB LTE variant, it''s pretty reasonable for the specs.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/nvidiashieldtablet5-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nvidia SHIELD"></figure></p><h3>Design</h3><p>On first glance, the Shield tablet looks a bit like an oversized .

Enough set up. Let''s jump into the review. </p><h3>A truly convertible tablet</h3><p>The first thing you''ll notice about the ThinkPad 10 is that it looks like most non-iPad tablets. It is slim and lightweight, and possesses a glossy Gorilla Glass frontside and a smooth, matte-finish backside &ndash; complete with the familiar ThinkPad logo; the glowing dot on top of the "i" included. Like all Windows tablets, there''s a bit too much bezel around the device, particularly in light of the . ThinkPad faithful may find themselves longing for that familiar rubberized surface that lines so many other devices in this brand, but it is nowhere to be found here.</p><p>The most striking aspect of this device however, is the sturdy, bright and colorful 10.1-inch, IPS touch display. The power button sits on the top-right corner of the unit when it is in landscape mode. Next to this sits a rotate lock, and the volume rocker is found on the right-hand side of the tablet.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/thinkpad17556logo-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad 10 review"></figure></p><p>Also noteworthy: the ThinkPad 10 comes kitted out with an impressive compliment of accessories, including a keyboard, a desktop dock, and a cover for the tablet itself. We''ll take a closer look at these peripherals later, but the keyboard and the dock are particularly interesting because of the enhanced mobile and desktop modes they enable.</p><p>Perhaps the most important attribute of this system, however, is its size and weight. Not surprisingly, the slate itself is the same size as most other tablets. But when paired with the optional keyboard accessory, it doubles in thickness, roughly to the size of a slim Ultrabook. Even better, it weighs in at just under 1.5 pounds.</p><p>One final note: unlike Lenovo''s Yoga and Flex lines, the ThinkPad 10 is a dedicated tablet first, and simply mounts onto a keyboard.

It gets updated and tweaked internals too, the most notable inclusion being Intel''s fourth generation  processor that Microsoft claims improves upon the Surface Pro''s battery life by 75%.</p><p>Despite its improvements, the Surface Pro 2 still suffers from something of an identity crisis. It isn''t really a better tablet as it''s still chunky and heavy, and Microsoft''s Windows Store has a long way to catch up to Apple''s App Store (and Google Play). That Facebook has only just bothered to release a Windows 8 app just about sums up the general lack of urgency around developers and the platform.</p><p>As with the Surface Pro, it''s easier to think of the Surface Pro 2 as a laptop that happens to look like a tablet, with portability and convenience being the main plus points on offer.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/420-20side20side-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Microsoft Surface 2 side"></figure></p><h3>Design</h3><p>Occasional -style overhauls aside, Apple has proved that iterating on the same design can be a formula for success in recent years, and Microsoft has banked on the same strategy with the Surface Pro 2.</p><p>Featuring the same magnesium body as the Surface Pro that Microsoft dubs "VaporMg", the Surface Pro 2 still manages to impress after a year that''s unearthed a slew of attractive rivals including Lenovo''s  and Sony''s kickstand-toting . Even Dell''s enterprise-focused  goes about business decked in a quietly attractive, no-frills matte casing.</p><p>We can''t help but feel a pang of disappointment that the Pro model is once again only available in black, while the Surface 2 is being offered in an attractive silver finish (according to Microsoft, all Surface tablets look like the Surface 2 before being painted black).</p><p>It''s clear that Microsoft wants the Surface Pro 2 to be the 200lbs Silver-Back Gorilla of the tablet world, but giving it a silver fox makeover like its Windows RT-toting sibling wouldn''t do it any harm either.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/720surface-back-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 2 back"></figure></p><p>The Surface Pro 2 still picks up a fair amount of scratches (not to mention fingerprints), so having a cloth on hand is recommended if that''s the sort of thing that irritates you.</p><p> Keep it clean and you''ll spot that Microsoft has replaced the Windows logo from the Surface Pro''s rear with the word "Surface".

Touch Covers are now $40 off, giving them a new starting point of $79, and a Limited Edition Touch Cover will cost $89.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/surface20pro20press202-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro review"></figure></p><p>Surface Pro looks like Surface RT, with the same distinctive look and the same full-size USB port - but it tweaks the iconic kickstand and the clever magnetic connectors for power and the two tear-off keyboards (Type Cover and  both work interchangeably with Surface Pro and RT).</p><p>It improves on the 10.6-inch touchscreen of the Surface RT with higher resolution and a digital pen you can use to scribble notes on the screen (and snap into the power port for carrying around), but it still has some of the darkest blacks you''ll find on any screen. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/surface20pro20with20pen-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro review"></figure></p><p>It''s a PC, but it''s still a tablet. Do you want it? Depends on what you really want.</p><p>If you''ve seen the Surface RT in the flesh, the Surface Pro looks utterly familiar. The same VaporMg coating over the same sturdy but sleek metal body, the same gently curved corners and wide black bezel, the same subtle Windows logo on the front.</p><p>But pick it up and you''ll notice the difference straight away. The Surface Pro is thicker - although 13.5mm (0.53 inches) rather than 9.3mm (0.37 inches) isn''t exactly bulky - and it''s heavier, at 907g (2lbs) rather than 680g (1.5lbs). But the weight is evenly distributed and well balanced so it doesn''t feel a lot heavier unless you pick them up side by side.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/surface20pro20press203-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro review"></figure></p> ', '', 'surface20pro20press201-160-80.jpg', 'surface20pro20press202-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'NOTE: This is a review of the 2012 Surface Pro - the  succeeded the device in', 'NOTE: This is a review of the 2012 Surface Pro - the  succeeded the device in 2013.

But, when it comes to its latest product, the , don''t pull out the torches and pitchforks just yet &ndash; Microsoft is onto something here.</p><p>Over the past few years, the Redmond, Wash. Windows maker has proved to be one of the bolder technology companies, for better or worse. Microsoft clearly isn''t afraid to fall on its face in the hope of landing on what in the world tech users want next in this turbulent market, and the Surface Pro 3 is &ndash; well, it just might be an exception.</p><p>The company has been hammering away at what it considers is a problem with tablets for years. Since the launch of the , Microsoft has sought after the ultimate mobile computing device, one that could replace the laptop with a tablet-first approach.</p><p> <object width="580" height="356"> <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Zu8tvK4hCh4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Zu8tvK4hCh4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="580" height="356"></embed> </object> </p><p>The Surface Pro 3 is closer than Microsoft has ever been to making good on that vision. After over a week with the slate, I''d go so far as to say that the Pro 3 is closer than any laptop-tablet hybrid released yet.</p><p>Microsoft was so sure of itself that not only did it directly compare the Pro 3 to Apple''s  and , it gave members of the press pre-release Surface Pro 3 units during an announcement event in New York. Sure, the units have bugs as of this review, but who cares? They''ll be fixed in time for the June 20 launch.</p><p>"I forced the giving away of the device, just so you''re aware," Surface team lead Panos Panay told me just after the reveal. "I said, ''You know what? I want the product in people''s hands.'' ''But the bugs are still there. They''re not all done until June 20, until it''s on market.'' I don''t care. The purity of the device is still true, and on June 20 there will be more drops."</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/surfacepro3-3-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 3 review"></figure></p><p>One look at the thing might explain Panay''s eagerness to get the Surface Pro 3. It''s no iPad Air, that''s for sure, but the iPad Air isn''t packing a 12-inch display.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>Yes, Microsoft bumped the Surface Pro touchscreen from a tiny 10.6 inches to a far roomier 12 inches. In the process, the pixel count has been upped from 1920 x 1080 to 2160 x 1440 The result is a modest boost in pixels per inch &ndash; 207 ppi to 216 ppi &ndash; given the increase in screen real estate.</p><p>More important is Microsoft''s interesting choice in aspect ratio. Rather than sticking with the Pro 2''s 16:9 or glomming onto the iPad''s 4:3, the firm went with a 3:2 aspect ratio. The company claims that, with this aspect ratio, this 12-inch screen can actually display more content than the MacBook Air''s 13.3-inch panel at 16:10. The move was also made to make the tablet feel more like your average notepad when held in portrait orientation.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/surfacepro3-1-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 3 review"></figure></p><p>Wrapped in a bright, silver-colored magnesium shell that''s cool and smooth to the touch, the Surface Pro 3 feels premium in every regard. The tablet keeps the trapezoidal shape of its predecessors, but manages to come in both thinner and lighter than before. Plus, the tablet''s upper half is beset by vents on its edges to better dissipate heat pushed out by its fan.</p><p>Microsoft also moved the Windows home button to the device''s left side of its silky smooth &ndash; though, rather thick &ndash; glass bezel. This way, it appears on the bottom of the slate while held upright, calling out, ''Hey, hold it this way now.'' While it''s no doubt the lightest Surface Pro yet, I''m not sure whether I could hold onto it for an entire subway ride home.</p><p>Adorning both sides of the Pro 3 are 5MP cameras capable of 1080p video recording. While stills on either shooter won''t blow you away, the front-facing lens should do just fine for Skype and the weekly video meeting over VPN.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/surfacepro3-2-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 3 review"></figure></p><h3>This Surface isn''t without its sidekick(s)</h3><p>A tablet wouldn''t be much of a laptop replacement without a keyboard, and the Surface Pro keyboard was in desperate need of a boost. Luckily, Microsoft sent the Type Cover back to the drawing board, and what came back is the best version yet. From keys with deeper travel and stronger feedback to a wider glass trackpad that actually clicks, nothing was off the table.</p><p>But the most important improvement is the brand new double hinge. Equipped with a strong magnet that latches onto the Pro 3''s lower bezel, the Type Cover can now rest with just a portion of it touching your lap or desk. This proved to make writing on my lap much more stable than with previous Surface devices. (Plus, the plush cover comes in five colors: red, blue, cyan, black and purple.)</p><p>Tucked beside the Type Cover is also the newly improved Surface Pen. Microsoft made a point of calling its stylus that, because the firm wants it to be seen as and feel like the writing instrument we''ve all grown up with. With an aluminum finish and a useful clicker up top, the Surface Pen is weighted to better feel like a pen. Using Bluetooth and powered by N-trig, the stylus tracks closer to its physical position than ever before, thanks to some major improvements to the Surface screen.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/surfacepro3-15-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 3 review"></figure></p><p>The new Surface Pro 3 inarguably has the look and feel of a premium product, so it only deserves to be stacked up against the most luxuriously built tablet and laptop around.</p> ', '', 'surfacepro3-hero-160-80.jpg', 'surfacepro3-3-580-90.jpg', NULL, 'Update: We''ve updated our Microsoft Surface Pro 3 review with a video', 'Update: We''ve updated our Microsoft Surface Pro 3 review with a video overview hosted by none other than TechRadar US editor-in-chief Wil O''Neal.

It''s even learned a few lessons from the Nexus 7, since this time Google isn''t bothering with a cripplingly small 8GB model and is making a 32GB version available from day one. </p><p>But opting for a dual-core processor rather than a quad-core one was a little surprising, and while it''s a lot less money than the latest iPad, the Google Nexus 10 could hardly be called cheap.

Rather, there is a small flap that, when flipped back, reveals the rear lens and automatically launches the Windows camera app.</p><h3>Crashy camera</h3><p>Normally I don''t shoot photos with a tablet, but the ThinkPad 8 is equipped with a rear camera that''s a step up from the iPads of the world. The 8MP sensor at the heart of this shooter can resolve some high-resolution images. However, image noise easily enters the frame unless photos are taken in bright, fully lit conditions.

The first few times I used the Quickshot Cover to turn on the camera, it sent the tablet into a panic that required a system reset. Other times, the tablet would simply display an unresponsive black screen, leaving me with no choice but turn it off completely. It was a frustrating experience, especially for missing those decisive, photographic moments.</p><p>That said, this is a known issue that can be somewhat remedied with a quick update downloaded through the baked-in Lenovo Solutions app. Even with the update in place, though, the camera is still quite buggy.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/lenovo20thinkpad20820review-3-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad 8 review"></figure></p><p>After updating, I triggered the camera only to have it loop back to a low-resolution version of the Windows Start Screen, with no way to access the desktop or any apps.

The "Pro" moniker definitely hints at the business market, aimed more as a working tablet than for casual web browsing in front of the television. </p><p>This is backed up by the inclusion of Samsung''s e-Meeting and Remote PC apps, as well as Cisco''s WebEx.</p><p>That said, casual users will be drawn to Samsung''s offering thanks to some hefty internal grunt and a suitably impressive screen. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsci0097-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 review"></figure></p><p>The Samsung tradition of eschewing metal products for a plastic back is continued in the white Tab Pro 10.1 I have in my hands, as is the same faux leather and stitch effect on the rear that was first seen on the .</p><p>Initially I found this to be a bit disappointing but the textured plastic is actually rather pleasant to hold and I soon found myself drawn to the stitch effect. Love it or hate it, it''s nice to see Samsung trying to break away from a traditional slab with a nod to the leather bound notebooks of old - and with the lower price tag, this seems to fit better.</p><p>It''s not a premium feel, but it''s a good one for gripping in a landscape mode.</p><p>Samsung has elected to offer the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 in both black and white, with the review model I had being the latter. In terms of a "pro" offering, I do feel that the black version is far better suited, as the white plastic seems like it would fit far better on a coffee table rather than at a desk.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsci0088-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 review"></figure></p><p>Wrapped in a 243.1 x 171.4 x 7.3mm frame and weighing a mere 469g, the Tab Pro 10.1 is easy to hold for long periods of time. The bezel also fits neatly between slim and stylish, whilst staying wide enough to allow a decent grip without leaving thumbs all over the screen.</p><p>This is a good call because there is no doubt that the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 screen is easily one of the best on the market. The 2560 x 1600 resolution leaves a density of 299ppi, higher than the 264ppi of the Retina Display on the .</p><p>This resolution matches that of the , however the screen felt brighter, meaning a more pleasant viewing experience, and one that was less strenuous on the eyes.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsci0091-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 review"></figure></p><p>I did find that there was the occasional problem with the auto-brightness coming out too dark even when adjusting the toggle, so I tended to keep the brightness on its maximum setting. This is a problem that I also found on the Asus and will hopefully be fixed in a software update.</p><p>Other hardware matches up to this high standard, with 2GB of RAM supporting an octa-core Exynos CPU. This is made up of four cores clocked at 1.9GHz and four smaller 1.3GHz cores.</p><p>Samsung has also opted to go for a traditional button layout, with the physical home key being flagged by the back and multi-tasking buttons. These are at the bottom when the Tab Pro 10.1 is held in landscape, something that makes more sense as I found that I held the tablet in landscape pretty much all the time. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsci0101-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 review"></figure></p><p>The 2MP front facing camera sits in the opposite bezel, making a lot of sense for video calling. A rear facing camera is also included packing a total of 8MP, alongside a flash.</p><p>I''ve never been an advocate of using a tablet as a camera, using it out and about felt more than a bit ridiculous, but the generous offering means that the Tab Pro 10.1 could prove to be a decent alternative to having to search through drawers to find your compact.</p><p>In terms of speakers and ports, the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 includes a microUSB port on the centre of the base, ideal for charging whilst using the tablet.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsci0114-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 review"></figure></p><p>The left and right sides house a dual speaker system, something I was equally impressed by as the speakers sat just above where I placed my hands. Below the right hand speaker is the microSD slot, whilst the headphone port sits above the left.</p><p>This left the power/lock button and volume rocker to be placed along the top, sitting relatively flush but standing out enough that I never found any problems in hitting them.</p><p>An infra-red blaster also seems to be included but the lack of Samsung''s WatchOn app left me a little confused. Overall though, it''s clear that Samsung has given its tablet design a lot of thought - albeit one that still doesn''t hold a candle to the likes of the iPad Air or even the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet, which has a more angular and industrial design.</p><p>Given the price differential between the Tab Pro 10.1 and the rest of the competition is now more marked, this is less of an issue though.

So far its matched the yearly refresh rate of Google and Apple, debuting the Kindle Fire HDX only twelve months after the first Kindle Fire HD. My those tablets grow up fast.</p><p>Amazon currently makes the best ereader on the market, the near perfect . It''s mopped up all competition from Nook and the like, but the 7-inch tablet is a different sort of game.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kindle-fire-hd-16-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX review"></figure></p><p>With the Kindle Fire HDX, it''s also built an excellent Android tablet, from a hardware perspective, at least.

It''s built a great tablet, an Android one despite what its Fire UI wants you to think. But while it excels at getting out of the way so you can read, watch and buy, buy, buy, is it lagging behind the feature curve set by Google and Apple? Let''s break it down.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>The 7-inch Kindle Fire HDX is no supermodel, but it is better looking than its predecessor, the brickish Kindle Fire HD.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kindle-fire-hd-3-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX review"><figcaption>Note the thinner bezel of the HDX on the right</figcaption></figure></p><p>A bit of thickness has been shaved off its frame, giving it a depth of .35 inches, whereas the old HD was .4 inches.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kindle-fire-hd-6-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX review"><figcaption>The new, thinner HDX is on top</figcaption></figure></p><p>It''s still a bit dull looking, especially from the front. The rear is actually more attractive, with subtly shiny black plastic and tapered, sloping edges.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kindle-fire-hd-4-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX review"></figure></p><p>It''s built from the same soft touch plastic material as the Kindle Paperwhite. It''s pleasant to hold and grippy without feeling sticky.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/rear20held20up-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX review"></figure></p><p>It weighs just 10.7 ounces, so it''s light enough to carry day to day without adding much weight to your bag. Its overall dimensions are 7.3 x 5 x .35 inches, making it easy to hold in one hand, but too large for a pocket.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/power20button-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX review"></figure></p><p>Amazon opted to place the power button and the volume rocker on rear of the HDX. They''re clicky and easy to press, but despite their sunken design, it''s often hard to locate them. We frequently mixed up where they were, especially when holding the HDX in portrait orientation.</p><p>The requisite 3.5 mm headphone jack is found on the right side, and a microUSB is on the left. Both do their jobs while keeping cords from trailing over the display. There''s also a front facing camera above the screen, but no camera on the back.</p><p>Overall, it''s a functional, but less than eye catching design. It looks like something a power tool company would design, a construction worker''s tablet, until you light up that screen. This is one of the places where Amazon''s hardware stands toe to toe with the competition.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/display20comic-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX review"></figure></p><p>The 7-inch LCD display rocks a resolution of 1920 x 1200 and an intense pixel density 323 ppi. Though seven inches isn''t a ton of visual real estate (this is a "mini" tablet, after all), it makes movies look magnificent and keeps text nice and crisp. It''s bright, colorful and among the best tablet displays on the market.</p><p>When we reviewed the Paperwhite, we bumped up against the limitations of a black and white display when trying to read comics or books with photographs. That''s in no way an issue here, the Kindle Fire HDX makes all your Amazon purchases look incredible. Of course, it''s more draining on the eyes than an e-ink display, but certainly the more versatile device of the two.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kindle-fire-hd-2-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX review"><figcaption>Nexus 7 to the left, HDX at the top, HD on the bottom</figcaption></figure></p><p>Its backlight is a bit less powerful than that of the Nexus 7, but in day to day use that won''t matter much, unless you''re prone to browsing in a completely dark room. We detected only one little flaw, a bit of black shadow along the display''s edge. It''s only visible when reading something with a completely white background like an ebook. Still, it''s a rather disappointing bit of quality control, like the dark spots that appeared on the first Paperwhite, but were gone by the second iteration.</p><p>Other than those dark spots, it stands among the best tablet displays on the market. Holding it next to a Nexus 7 or any Retina iPad, you''d be hard pressed to notice a difference, so it doesn''t best the competition, but watching a film on an HDX is just as nice as on any high-density 7-inch tablet.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/rear20speaker20and20rocker-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX review"></figure></p><p>The HDX has fine speakers as well. They''re mounted on the back of the tablet, near the top, so it''s easy to hold the tablet without covering them up.</p><p>We''ve heard louder sound on other tablets, but even at maximum volume, the HDX is free from the distortion that sometimes popped up on last year''s model. It doesn''t scream, but it''s good enough to watch videos outside in a park without switching on the subtitles.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/origami20cover20closed-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX review"></figure></p><p>We don''t often talk about accessories in a device review, but the origami case sold by Amazon deserves a shout out. It''s quite expensive at &pound;45 for plastic and &pound;50 for leather, but it''s a really elegant combination of protective cover and stand.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/kindle-fire-hd-15-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Amazon Kindle Fire HDX review"></figure></p><p>When closed up, it lays flat across the display and the rear, shielding it from scuffs and scratches while adding little to the devices bulk. It converts to a stand by folding the flap back and pinching it together. It holds it at a perfect horizontal angle for movie watching, and keeps it upright in portrait mode as well, though with a slight lean.</p><p>The cover sticks to the rear with a magnet of impressive strength. You can hold it by the flap and give it a shake without causing a tumble. If you''re buying an HDX, you really ought to consider some sort of cover, if not this one.

The price has been bumped up - it''s now &pound;199 for the 16GB model that would have cost &pound;159 before - but the specs are much better, so it''s still very reasonably priced. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ov2-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nexus 7 review"></figure></p><p>And it looks a lot better too.

Suffice to say, this is one beautiful piece of equipment. The front is one sheet of high gloss Gorilla glass, interrupted only by the minute presence of a front-facing camera for selfies and Skypes. </p><p>It''s thinner and lighter than before (200 x 114 x 8.7mm and 290g, compared to 198.5 x 120 x 10.5mm and 340g). Eagle-eyed mathematicians will notice there is a slight height increase, but it''s negligible in practice. The LTE version adds another 9g. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0771-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nexus 7 review"></figure></p><p>Whereas before there was a plastic trim around the bezel, painted to look like metal, here it''s gone. This is an all-black device. The screen just blends into the sides, which curve round to create an uninterrupted back panel. And if I had to find fault, it would be with this bit. </p><p>Firstly, the bezels have been shrunk right down to make the screen almost extend to the edges. But it makes it difficult to hold the Nexus 7, because the natural act of curling your hand around the tablet and resting your thumb on the bezel is now impossible without touching the screen and causing all kinds of annoyances. Instead, you have to rethink how you hold the tablet. </p><p>True, it can be held fully within the palm, but that''s quite tiring after a while and not particularly comfortable. Others have taken to holding the Nexus 7 like a giant phone, resting the pinky at the bottom and the thumb at the side. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0779-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nexus 7 review"></figure></p><p>Yet while this is possible, it''s again not the most comfortable experience. The power/sync port at the bottom ends up digging into the skin and the angular left hand corner digs into the palm. </p><p>Added to that, the back is no longer textured but a matte plastic, and therefore grip is reduced. It''s not going to cause you sleepless nights, but it is going to bug some people (like me) at first. Thankfully, most people will keep their Nexus 7 in a case of some, and that makes this much less of an issue. </p><p>Another thing to mention is fingerprints. You have never seen a fingerprint magnet like this. Prepare for lots of rubbing the Nexus 7 against legs (preferably your own) to combat smudges.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/aimgp0411-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nexus 7 review"></figure></p><p>Aside from that Micro USB port at the bottom, there is little to remark on. Asus and Google have deliberately gone for minimalism here. </p><p>Look hard on the front and you may see a notification light beneath the screen - but that only appears when your attention is needed. There''s a power/sleep button on the right-hand side, accompanied by volume rocker. </p><p>On the back has an etched Nexus logo, along with another addition: the rear camera, which was one thing many original Nexus 7 owners craved. It''s fine for showing someone something on Skype - but if you have intentions of using your tablet as a camera, as some antisocial types do, then frankly you need taking outside and giving a firm telling off to.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0793-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nexus 7 review"></figure></p><p>One thing you will notice is two lots of speakers - stereo, if you will. All mod cons here, it appears. They''re on the top and bottom at the rear but the idea is that when you watch stuff in landscape, they''ll be at the sides. </p><p>Oddly, they''re at the back, facing away from you, which seems silly when you consider that HTC has moved the bar with the . But we''ll find out how they fare a little later.</p><p>Altogether, this is a solid device. Where the original Nexus sometimes felt like a compromise due to the price (issues of light bleed and creakiness on the left hand side were common complaints), this feels like a premium, well-put-together piece of kit that should command more than the measly amount Google is asking.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/aimgp0423-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Nexus 7 review"></figure></p><p>This is definitely most apparent when you see the screen. The only word that fits here is "wow." The PPI of the original Nexus 7 represented one of its missed opportunities: at 216 (800 x 1280) it was by no means bad, but it always felt like it could have been just that little bit better. </p><p>And now it is. Google and Asus have pushed the density on the Nexus 7 up to the competition''s level and beyond. It''s now a staggering 323ppi (1200 x 1920). Consider the iPad''s Retina display is 264ppi and you can imagine just how razor sharp this is. Text pops out and images look almost inexpressibly crisp. </p><p>Add to that the fact that there is virtually no gap between glass and screen, and this is a display to die for. Viewing angles could not be better - which is great, because tablets are more likely to be shared around than phones - and crispness is unmatched. </p><p>Naturally, the glass makes it less than ideal for outdoor use, but if you set brightness to maximum it should be able to cope. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/aimgp0410-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/htc-one-1131862/review"></figure></p><p>Yes, it''s a game of one upmanship to a certain degree. In all likelihood, you don''t <em>need </em>a display that sharp. But by God, do I want it. And I love it. Sure, the Retina iPad Mini gives the Nexus 7 a run for its money, but you can''t do much better on a tablet in terms of display.</p><p>Colour reproduction is also far better. A common complaint with the original Nexus 7 was that images tended to look faded and washed out. Again, I couldn''t grumble too much because of the price, but it was one of those things that we geeks tended to notice and grind our teeth at. Thankfully, everything now just appears much warmer on the Nexus 7 than before. </p><p>It''s still a world away from the brightness and vividity of Samsung''s displays employed on the likes of the  or the , but they are loved and loathed in equal measure. Some think they look great, while for others the effect is unnatural. </p><p>Either way, the fact is, unless you''re odd, you won''t pick up a Nexus 7, look at the display and feel disappointed in the slightest.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0778-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="New Nexus 7 review"></figure></p><p>What you might feel disappointed with, however, is the storage issue. You won''t find a Nexus 7 with anything more than 32GB of space - and remember, Google doesn''t do external memory these days. In its efforts to push us all onto the cloud, you''re stuck with what Google deems to be adequate. </p><p>And as we''ve become used to, that 32GB on the box doesn''t mean you get 32GB to play with, as the OS takes up a huge chunk. You''re left with just 26GB. With the size of some HD games, plus a couple of movies, you''ll eat that up fairly easily. Obviously, the 16GB is even more dire in this regard.</p><p>There are two things Google could have done here: either given the option of a larger device (64GB or 128GB), or relented and left an SD slot for those who want to expand. Samsung still does that with the Note 8.0, as does Sony with the , and neither experience too many problems. </p><p>But larger memories would mean higher prices and that ruins the Nexus 7''s USP. Increasing storage would mean Google losing face. It''s a vicious circle, and it''s the punters who lose out. If you are a media fiend, the paltry allowance might mean the Nexus 7 isn''t the tablet for you, despite how great your content would look on that screen. </p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/dsc0789-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="Nexus 7 review"></figure></p><p>As with most modern devices, you''ll find a sensor which adjusts the display to make sure you are getting optimum backlighting for battery power conservation. I found it to be pretty unremarkable - it just does what it should do. </p><p>However, if you decide to turn it off and put the display onto full manual brightness, make sure you''ve some sunglasses handy. This is one bright son of a gun, and you <em>will </em>be dazzled.</p><p>The battery has taken a hit, at least on paper. It''s no longer 4325mAh and now reports for duty at 3950mAh. But Google appears to have some method in this madness. Aside from the fact that it makes the Nexus 7 lighter than the original, it doesn''t seem to have much of an impact. </p><p>In fact, I''d say that the battery here is better than the original Nexus 7. Android 4.4 is great at battery management. When this unit goes to sleep, it goes to sleep. Not a slumber, not a doze, but a complete conk-out. And yet, it''ll stand to attention at a second''s notice when you need it again.</p> ', '', 'new20nexus20720google20play-160-80.jpg', 'ov2-580-100.jpg', NULL, 'The original Nexus 7 enchanted and enthralled - and did so despite some slight compromises.

When you hear all the numbers being bandied about you''d rightly assume that you''d feel something that was almost ghost-like in the hand, a tablet that could almost get blown away.</p><p>And we''re utterly not disputing that - the iPad Air is the most balanced tablet on the market, with great precision going into the engineering throughout. However, if you''ve touched an iPad mini or just haven''t held an older iPad for a while (and with some people we tested with, even those that had) you won''t feel as much of a step up as you''d be expecting.</p><p>We''ve added that caveat to brace you should you be excited to purchase the new iPad, as it''s not something that affects the general usage in any way, with one-handed holding very easy, and something that puts the Air into a new product category.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ipadairreview201-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPad Air review"></figure></p><p>The design of the iPad Air is, as we''ve mentioned, very impressive. Yes, it''s totally based on the iPad mini, and the smooth aluminium back is really great to feel in the hand. It''s a shame that most people feel the need to slap a cover on an iPad as soon as it''s bought - while we get the notion of protection, it hides away some cracking design.</p><p>That said, at least it keeps the fingers away from the chassis, and the iPad Air is a real magnet for prints. The back cover isn''t too bad, but the mirrored Apple logo sucks down finger oil and is loathe to give it back even with hard scrubbing with a cloth.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ipadairreview203-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPad Air review"></figure></p><p>It might not sound like a big deal, but it makes your premium new tablet look a bit unkempt right from the start.</p><p>But in actual operation, the design of the iPad Air complements the impressive innards superbly. It''s unsurprisingly not possible to hold your hand the entire way around the edge of the Air, but then again it''s so light (and comes with the ability to disregard erroneous thumbs entering the screen, again like the iPad mini) that it doesn''t really make a big difference.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ipadairreview208-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPad Air review"></figure></p><p>The rest of the buttonry - the top-mounted power key and the silencing rocker switch and volume buttons at the side - haven''t moved far, but protrude nicely to make them very easy to hit no matter when you''re holding the device - being able to find such things without looking is often sacrificed in the quest to make tablets look sleeker, so we''re happy Apple has gone the other way here.</p><p>There is one note of criticism in terms of design for such a decent (and still expensive, despite costing the same as many of its peers) piece of kit: the screen has a plastic thud to it when tapping, thanks to the smaller and lighter innards.</p><p>It''s most noticeable when grazed with a fingernail, although in a case the effect is lessened. We''re surprised Apple let this feature go unchallenged, but it seems in making the design thinner and removing part of the inner cage the overall strength of the chassis is somewhat reduced.</p><p>It''s not a major issue by any means, and certainly one that you''ll only pick up on sporadically, but it''s still enough to irk at times when you''re expecting a truly premium experience.</p><p>Many of you will also be wondering why there''s no  onboard the iPad AIr when it''s such a large selling point for the i.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/ipadairreview2011-580-100.jpg" width="580" alt="iPad Air review"></figure></p><p>We''re in the same boat.

While sales of tablet PCs themselves are in rude health &ndash; the  and  are doing very well, whilst small-form tablets such as the  and the  have also found success. However, while there is good news for Apple and Android devices,  tablets &ndash; especially ones running  have been far from successful. Can the Toshiba Encore succeed where others, such as the  have failed?</p><p>There are a few areas that things look good for the Toshiba Encore &ndash; at least on paper. For a start it''s one of the new breed of smaller, eight-inch Windows 8 tablets, eschewing the larger, more cumbersome, size of previous Windows 8 tablets, for something more comfortable to hold. It also comes preinstalled with , Microsoft''s update that fixed a number of problems, and addressed a number of complaints, that were levelled at Windows 8 when it first launched. It''s also important to note that the Toshiba Encore comes with Windows 8.1 and not Windows 8.1 RT. </p><p>What this means is that the Encore comes with an Intel Atom Quad Core processor, and can run legacy Windows programs (unlike Windows 8.1 RT, which can only run Windows 8 apps). This gives the tablet a bit more power, and far more flexibility, though it does mean that battery life won''t be quite as long as ARM-based tablets. The battery trade off in return for more functionality is a tricky balance that Windows 8 tablets struggle to get right &ndash; so it will be interesting to see if Toshiba has judged it correctly with the Encore.</p><p>With Sony recently announcing that it''s  of the Windows-based PC market, and Microsoft''s own  its Surface tablets, attention will surely turn to any manufacturer that can make a truly successful Windows 8 tablet. Will Toshiba strike gold with the Encore, or will it be just another noble failure that simply couldn''t compete with its iOs and Android opponents? Let''s take a look.</p><h3>Specifications</h3><p>Quite possibly the biggest draw of the Toshiba Encore is its eight-inch screen. While sometimes bigger can often mean better, seven and eight-inch tablets have been diligently carving out a healthy niche for people who want a screen that''s bigger than a phone, and yet still easy and comfortable to carry around. The size of the Toshiba Encore means that it can be held reasonably comfortably in one hand, though the large bezel around the screen, and slightly bulky depth to the machine, means it''s not quite as light as it could be. </p><p>It also means the Toshiba Encore misses out on a premium look and feel as well, and instead brings to mind the various budget Android tablets we''ve tested in the past. The 8-inch screen is decent, but with only 1280 x 800 it lacks the clarity and sharpness of a full 1080p display &ndash; and is certainly no match for the iPad''s high-resolution Retina display. Still, it does the job, displaying web pages and online video pretty well, and it also has decent viewing angles.</p><p><figure><img src="http://worldgadget.net/uploads/hanews/toshiba-encore61160-100052699-orig-580-90.jpg" width="580" alt="Toshiba Encore"><figcaption>Not the highest-res screen we''ve seen</figcaption></figure></p><p>The processor in the Toshiba Encore is an Intel Atom Z3740, clocked at 1.33GHz. The latest version of Intel''s mobile Atom chips, the Z3740 is based on Intel''s new Bay Trail (http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/why-intel-s-bay-trail-is-the-next-big-thing-in-mobile-computing-1181901) 22nm architecture. These new chips are the closest Intel has come to combining power (they''re quad-core with twice the speed of previous chips, and three times the graphics power) with mobility &ndash; less heat is produced, so the device they are in can be smaller, as well has having longer battery life. </p><p>As well as being the first quad-core Atom processors Intel has produced, the integrated graphics of the Z3740 support a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1600. Pretty impressive, especially when compared to the previous generation of Atom CPUs (Clover Trail), which could only achieve 1366 x 768. This means that, at least on paper, the Toshiba Encore''s graphics performance is actually held back by the low resolution of the screen, rather than the onboard graphics &ndash; a reversal of what we see in many tablets &ndash; especially budget ones.</p><p>Alongside the processor we get 2GB of RAM, a 64GB hard drive, Bluetooth, wireless N, GPS and two webcams (one on the front, and one on the back).

If the deal goes through, it will be yet another sign that Apple is finally catching on to the fact that iTunes, brilliant as it might once have been, is no longer the way most people prefer to get their audio content. Why pay-per-song when you can stream for free?</p>\n<p class="adAvoidedButFlowable">No company deserves more credit for changing the way people consume music than Apple. With the iPod and iTunes, <a href="http://worldgadget.net/tablets/apple.html">Apple </a>ushered in the age of the mp3, and rendered the CD, as well as many music pirating sites, obsolete. But ever since Pandora introduced us all to unlimited streaming radio, the iTunes approach has become somewhat outdated. That''s even more true now that Spotify lets us play specific songs and compile them into playlists for free. All the while, Apple clung to its a la carte model with iTunes, and in doing so, it&#160;not only lost market share, but failed to create a substantial competitor to these other services.</p>\n<p>Now, however, Apple is spending lots of money to catch up. Last fall, the company launched its own streaming service, iTunes Radio. But while a recent study found that it''s now the third most popular streaming service out there,it has nothing on Pandora''s traction. Not accustomed to being beaten at its own game, Apple is now putting its full heft behind building a better streaming service.</p>\n<p>The Beats acquisition is the most obvious example. Apple Senior VP Eddy Cue&#160;recently called Beats Music, the "first music subscription service done right," and acknowledged that Beats'' team of music industry veterans, including Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre, made the company an especially appealing target.</p>\n<p>But the possible Swell deal -- valued at $30 million (£18 million) -- suggests Apple is approaching the space from all angles, targeting not just music, but podcasting as well. Swell lets users personalise their podcasts based on their interests and learns more about them based on the podcasts they skip or listen to. The problem is that NPR, perhaps the biggest brand in podcasting,&#160;just released a similar app of its own. According to&#160;<em>Re/Code</em>, Swell has never been particularly popular with users anyway, and will likely shut down once the deal is closed.</p>\n<p>Like Beats, the Swell purchase is most likely a talent acquisition, and a relatively small one at that. But even if Apple can acquire all the talent it would need to create a streaming service to truly rival Pandora, the company would still need to convince consumers that iTunes is no longer simply a service for finding music you want to buy.</p>\n<p>The question is: Is it too late? Apple may have a much larger library of songs, but Pandora has an overwhelming head start perfecting its recommendation algorithms. It doesn''t matter how many songs iTunes Radio has access to: If it doesn''t play the songs you want to listen to -- and many agree it doesn''t -- it won''t be able to compete with Pandora''s highly accurate suggestions. And, unlike the rest of the streaming players, with the exception of Spotify, Apple has always been hesitant to launch web services.</p>\n<p>Instead, Apple tends to build apps so rich they can imitate the web. But the reality is that the web is still the fastest way to lure users. People are often reluctant to download an app until they''ve tested it online first. Unless Apple is willing to do things differently this time and break a few of its own rules, iTunes Radio will likely remain a runner up.</p>', '', 'swell.jpg', '', NULL, 'Apple buys Swell to up its audio streaming power', 'If that $3 billion Beats acquisition didn’t convince you that Apple is serious about the radio business, this will', '29/07/2014', 0, 1),

They found that 12 percent of those people had at one point or another experienced auditory echoes of the games they played. The majority of those echoes were made up of sound effects, music and characters'' voices, and did not need triggers to come to life.</p>\n<p>Some of the 155 gamers in question heard them through the night, and others for two days in a row after playing for a longer stretch. But it didn''t matter what the individual hearing them was doing -- it was not something tied to a dreamlike state before bed, but something they would hear during the day and while going about their usual lives and routines.</p>\n<p>The gamers would complete phrases they heard in their minds, confuse real life sounds for those in the video game and sometimes hear music while involuntarily moving their fingers (presumably, as though playing the game). "Occasionally, the vividness of the sound evoked thoughts and emotions that resulted in behaviours and copying strategies," write the authors.</p>\n<p>The entire paper relates to something called Game Transfer Phenomena, a niche and new realm of research being pioneered by the International Gaming Research Unit. For some years now, the department has explored the theory, collecting anecdotal evidence that suggests their subjects, after playing a game for a long time, could transfer content from the game into their real lives, momentarily. It''s something a lot of people will be familiar with, but had not been the subject of deep academic analysis and was in fact a condition only recently named by the department, led by professor Mark Griffiths.</p>\n<p>The group has recorded stories of auditory, visual and tactile echoes experienced by avid gamers.&#160;Speaking to the Guardian in 2011, Griffiths said, "We had the example of a teacher who dropped his pen and immediately reached for a joypad button to retrieve it, as though he were in a game". He speaks about it as a conditioned response -- do something enough times, and in the real world, if anything similar happens, the game memory will be triggered and mirrored into the real world context.</p>\n<p>Plenty of other academic studies have categorised the phenomena, though the current one is the first to analyse auditory cues in depth.&#160;In 2005, one paper&#160;showed how more cortisol was delivered in the body when techno music played in violent video games -- it induced a physiological stress response. In another, a team found that video games manipulated to show more realistic blood and play more realistic screams induced higher physiological arousal.</p>\n<p>This is of course, what a good video game is sometimes designed to do. In an action title for example, if you''re not feeling the excitement, and heart rates are placid, you''re probably bored in some cases. Of course, anecdotes of someone hearing the word "death" whispered to them for days, as the Nottingham team found, is highly disconcerting, and they report that some subjects said they felt scared, maddened, and like they were "going crazy".</p>\n<p>These types of studies are generally reserved for the most intense gamers out there, however, and the authors do note that the symptoms are hardly a permanent fixture to be worried about.</p>\n<p>"Game Transfer Phenomena appears to be commonplace among excessive gamers and most of these phenomena are short-lasting, temporary, and resolve of their own accord," said Griffiths, in a statement. "For some gamers, the phenomena are conditioned responses, therefore the best way for the tiny minority that may have longer lasting phenomena is to simply cut down the amount they play."</p>\n<p class="adAvoidedButFlowable">Ortiz De Gortari notes, importantly, that it is work like her''s and her team''s that can help shed light on this phenomena for avid gamers troubled by the experiences.

What Nexus 6 features should we expect? Will it even be dubbed the Nexus 6 given the mooted move to ''Google Silver'' branding? These are all still things we are waiting to be confirmed.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>Although Google has yet to give an official voice to all these questions, a raft of Nexus 6 leaks and rumours are starting to give us a pretty good insight into the device.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>We will be updating this page with all the latest Nexus 6 release date details, leaks, news and rumours as new information emerges, so bookmark it now.&#160;</span><br />\n<br />\n<h3>Nexus 6 Release Date: When will it come out?</h3>\n<br />\n<span>The Nexus 5 was announced on October 31st 2013 and went on sale the following month while the Nexus 4 was unveiled almost the same time a year before that. So, based on previous launches we are tipping the Nexus 6 release date to be held around the same time of year.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>As luck would have it, this timeframe would also coincide nicely with the launch of&#160;</span>Android L<span>, the latest major update to Google''s mobile operating system.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>Google hasn''t stuck to the same product cycles for other Nexus hardware, specifically the&#160;</span>Nexus 10<span>, but it has been more consistent for its Nexus handsets. The chances of turning up before October are slim considering we are now almost into August but it''s not entirely out of the question.&#160;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>Maybe we won''t see the Nexus 6 at all. The latest from serial leaker @evleaks suggests the Nexus 6 is no longer going to happen tweeting: "There''s is no Nexus 6. Farewell, Nexus."</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>This however has been contradicted by two developers who spotted a mention of Nexus 6 alongside the rumoured&#160;</span>Nexus 8<span>&#160;tablet in the Chromium issue tracker although it didn''t reveal any details on specs.</span><br />\n<br />\n<img class="tr-behaviour-enlargeable " alt="Nexus 6 concept" src="http://worldgadget.net/uploaded/news/HTC-nexus-6-concept23.jpg" id="news-18703-129884" width="616" height="347" /><br />\n<h3>Nexus 6 Specs: LG G3 Lite with 64-bit power</h3>\n<br />\n<span>The Nexus 5 was and is still a firm favourite at&#160;</span><em>TrustedReviews</em><span>&#160;HQ. It has a brilliant 5-inch Full HD screen, an impressive 8-megapixel camera and zippy overall performance. Best of all, for £300 it offers great value for money. The Nexus 6 certainly has a tough act to follow.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>If LG are tasked with building the Nexus 6 just as they did with the Nexus 5 and Nexus 4, it''s strongly suggested that the&#160;</span>LG G3<span>&#160;smartphone will provide the foundations for the next Google smartphone. That''s according to a ''business-related source'' quoted by Gizmodo.de that claims the Nexus 6 will be a "lightweight" version of the LG G3. That suggests we might not see some of the more premium features like 2K touchscreen display.&#160;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>Prior to Google’s I/O conference, LG though seemingly ruled itself out of the running to make the next Google Nexus smartphone. Speaking to Dutch site Draadbreuk, LG Communications Director Ken Hong suggested that the LG G3-makers had not been approached by Google to produce the Nexus 6.&#160;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>Hong stated that if the company was chosen they’d normally be informed. He also added, ““That can mean two things. Either I got ignored, or we simply won’t be making [the Nexus 6].”</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>That''s however contradicted by website Ausdroid citing an unnamed source within Google close to the project that work on the Nexus 6 is well and truly underway and will feature a LG G3 mimicking 5.5-inch display as the standout feature.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>The&#160;</span>LG G2<span>&#160;and the Nexus 5 share very similar specs lists like display resolution, processor power and some design elements so it''s a fair assessment that the G3 and Nexus 6 could be closely linked as well.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>While the&#160;</span>HTC One M8<span>&#160;and the&#160;</span>Xperia Z2<span>&#160;upgraded to the new Snapdragon 801 processors, it''s rumoured that the Nexus 6 will move to a MediaTek 64-bit processor. That''s according to Taiwain''s Economic Daily News which claims the new Nexus will be powered by a “quad-core MT6732 64-bit chip clocked at 1.5GHz, or the octa-core MT6752 SoC running at a frequency of 2.0GHz.”&#160;</span><br />\n<br />\n<img class="tr-behaviour-enlargeable " alt="Nexus 6 concepts" src="http://worldgadget.net/uploaded/news/nexus-6-concept-nexus6price.jpg" id="news-18703-129883" width="616" height="347" /><br />\n<strong><br />\nNexus 6 concept via&#160;Nexus6Price.com</strong><br />\n<br />\n<span>The Nexus 5 is certainly no slouch thanks to its quad-core 2.27GHz Snapdragon 800 CPU with 2GB of RAM but a move to a 64-bit CPU could potentially make the Nexus 6 a real powerhouse. Battery life though is one of the Nexus 5''s weaker points and we hope this is something that will be addressed for the next handset.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>The 8-megapixel camera with flash and optical image stabilization on the Nexus 5 is good but it''s no match for leading cameras on the HTC One M8, Sony Xperia Z2 or the Samsung Galaxy S5. There’s definitely room for improvement here.&#160;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>One thing we can be sure about is that the Nexus 6 will run on Android L and should benefit from features like a new interface look, redesigned nav soft keys, dynamic ''heads up'' notifications and improved GPU support.</span><br />\n<br />\n<h3>Nexus 6 Rumours: Fingerprint Tech and Bigger Display</h3>\n<br />\n<span>According to Android Geeks and an unnamed "trusted insider", the Nexus 6 will follow the iPhone 5S and Samsung Galaxy S5 by adding a fingerprint sensor. It also suggests that it will move to a 5.2-inch QHD display already confirmed for the LG G3. The LG-built Nexus 4 featured a 4.7-inch display before moving to a 5.2-inch screen for the Nexus 5 so there''s clearly a trend here to go bigger.</span><br />\n<br />\n<img class="tr-behaviour-enlargeable " alt="Nexus 6 concepts" src="http://worldgadget.net/uploaded/news/Nexus-6-concept-jermaine-sm.jpg" id="news-18703-129882" width="616" height="347" /><br />\n<strong><br />\nNexus 6 concept by Jermain Smit via&#160;Concept Phones</strong><br />\n<br />\n<span>HTC Nexus 6 anyone? Well, this seems unlikely but that''s not stopped</span><span>&#160;the speculation.&#160;</span><span>The HTC One M8-makers have been linked to building a&#160;</span>Nexus 8<span>&#160;tablet but there''s very little rumours to suggest anything other than LG taking the reigns once again.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>Maybe, just maybe Google will ditch the Nexus 6 altogether. According to slides published by Android Police, ''Android Silver'' phones which comprise of several high end phones from top manufacturers could spell the end of the Nexus program. The Silver phones will run on the latest version of Google''s mobile operating system at all times, get access to the updates first and have minimal carrier and manufacturer software added on top.&#160;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>Other rumoured features include a service similar to Apple''s "Find My iPhone" and 24/7 Google Hangout to help out customers in the same way MayDay tech support does on Amazon''s Kindle Fire tablets.</span><br />\n<br />\n<h3>Nexus 6 Price:&#160; How much will new Nexus smartphone cost?</h3>\n<span>This has been key to the success of the most recent Nexus smartphones. Offering excellent value for money. When the Nexus 5 originally went on sale it cost £300 making it cheaper than leading smartphones from HTC, Samsung and Sony. It even dropped down to £240 at one point making it even more of a steal.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>We''d like to think Google will still be able to offer the new Nexus at a similar price point as there are very few phones in the same price bracket that can compete with it. However, if Google does decide to go with this new Android Silver approach, this could spell the end of a reasonably priced, well-specced SIM-free Android phone and that would be disappointing.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>Stay tuned for all the latest Nexus 6 rumours and breaking Nexus 6 release dates right here.</span><span><br />\n</span>', '', 'Nexus-6-concept-Dmitry-Stvo.jpg', '', NULL, 'Nexus 6 release date, rumours, news', 'All you need to know about the Nexus 6, smartphone sequel to the Nexus 5', '30/07/2014', 0, 1),
